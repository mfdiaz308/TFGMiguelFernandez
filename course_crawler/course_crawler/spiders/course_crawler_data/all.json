        "description": "Instructor:  Stephen T Parente   In the Healthcare Marketplace specialization capstone course, key skills are engendered from the four prior courses to create an original medical innovation valuation.   The first course in the specialization teaches the learner to size a population or market.  The second course teaches whether the clinician will or will not find value from deploying a new innovation.  The third course identifies the competitive landscape of medical technology innovations to compete or complement.  The fourth course, teaches how to put a monetary value on the improvement in health resulting from a new innovation.  The summary of these elements creates a document of high strategic value where the learner has demonstrated not only an understanding of the marketplace but what is required for the marketplace to advance. This is what is accomplished during the Healthcare Marketplace capstone experience. ",

Krishna Yunus Social Business Fund Bengaluru 5 Courses  2,755 learners Gautam Kaul Yunus Social Business Fund Bengaluru 24 Courses  109,695 learners OK This course is part of a Specialization titled Strategy and Finance for a Lifecycle of a Social Business. It is an introduction to time value of money and will help the learner understand the basics of finance with the ultimate goal of valuing a company from a societal lens.  The beauty of the modern decision-making framework is that it can be used to understand value creation at any level  the individual, the corporate or nonprofit entity level and from the point of view of society. The applications however become increasingly complex as your lens expands from the individual to the corporate/nonprofit to the global society. In this Specialization we will therefore focus on understanding the frameworks and tools that an individual and an entity (a startup or an established corporation, private or public) can use to understand value enhancing decision-making.\n\nThere are two building blocks of decision making  time value of money and risk. \nIn this first course, we will therefore start with an introduction to time value of money geared toward individual decision-making to both explore and measure the value of our decisions. In the second course, we will use the same framework to evaluate decision-making by entities  businesses  to create value. We will realize how the evaluating value from the lens of multiple stakeholders is inherently more complex. You are also encouraged to think from a societal standpoint because that, ultimately, is the difference between a social and a private business. The societal perspective is the most complex and market prices are typically not available for both the benefits and costs. \n\nAlthough introductory, this course will enable any learner to understand and analyze many decisions they regularly confront. It will also serve very useful if you are keen to hone your finance skills to make good personal decisions. \n\nThe beauty of modern frameworks and tools of analysis is that they are logical and do not change depending on the purpose of business. However, to demonstrate social impact is very complex because prices for both the public good, and any harm created by our actions, are not available. It is also challenging to determine the incremental effect of a business on society at large.  The combination of these issues makes all social impact and value specific to a business, making it even more important to use the same frameworks and tools developed in this Specialization while evaluating any/all impacts of a business.

Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If youre already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give you ideas for turbocharging successful learning, including counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of your time on homework and problem sets. If youre struggling, youll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If youve ever wanted to become better at anything, this course will help serve as your guide.\n\nThis course can be taken independent of, concurrent with, or prior to, its companion course, Mindshift. (Learning How to Learn is more learning-focused, and Mindshift is more career-focused.)

Do you want to grow your ability to recognize - and do something about - injustice in the energy space?\n\nAre you a sustainability or environmental professional eager to help design just energy systems?\n\nDo you wonder how to help advance equity in your communitys energy decisions?\n\nThis course is for you!\n\nEnergy is the lifeblood of the modern way of life.  Yet not everyone has equal access to its benefits, and the environmental and social costs of producing, transporting, and using it are not evenly distributed.  In this course you will explore the idea and practice of energy justice:  what does it look like?  Why are societies struggling to achieve it?  What do we mean by sociotechnical energy systems, and how can we make them more equitable? \n\nThe purposes of this course are (1) to introduce individuals and organizations to the concept of energy justice and where it comes from, and (2) to help them build a toolkit to identify and leverage opportunities to increase fairness and equity in energy-related decisions and actions. After completing this course, learners should be better equipped to recognize and confront energy injustice in their personal and professional lives, and to help envision and foster energy justice in society.\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to: \n\n Define energy justice and explain its relationship to environmental justice, climate justice, and energy  democracy\n Define structural inequity and describe the impact of historical racism on today's energy systems\n Describe the social complexity of energy systems as well as their major physical elements\n Identify and explain key energy justice principles and frameworks\n Distinguish between multiple forms of injustice in energy systems and analyze potential remedies\n Discuss energy injustice and structural inequality with fluency\n Identify and assess energy injustices in personal, professional and civic contexts\n Design strategies to integrate energy justice into professional work and civic life\n Advocate for energy justice as an essential element of energy transitions and climate change mitigation\n Envision more just energy futures ",

You will now walk through a complete machine learning project to prepare a machine learning maintenance roadmap. You will understand and analyze how to deal with changing data. You will also be able to identify and interpret potential unintended effects in your project. You will understand and define procedures to operationalize and maintain your applied machine learning model. By the end of this course you will have all the tools and understanding you need to confidently roll out a machine learning project and prepare to optimize it in your business context.  To be successful, you should have at least beginner-level background in Python programming (e.g., be able to read and code trace existing code, be comfortable with conditionals, loops, variables, lists, dictionaries and arrays). You should have a basic understanding of linear algebra (vector notation) and statistics (probability distributions and mean/median/mode).\n\nThis is the final course of the Applied Machine Learning Specialization brought to you by Coursera and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii).

        "description": "What makes a successful arts and cultural organization? Led by DeVos Institute Chairman Michael M. Kaiser and President Brett Egan, this course will introduce you to a management theory called the Cycle which supports thriving arts and cultural organizations. Learning from our work with managers from over 80 countries around the world, the DeVos Institute developed the Cycle as a simple, but powerful tool to assist managers in their effort to respond to an increasingly complex environment and propel their institutions to excellence.  The Cycle explains how great art and strong marketing can create a family of supporters, who in turn help the organization produce the revenue required to support even more great art the next year. The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.\n\nBy taking this course, you will learn: \n\n the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization; \n how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work; \n how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers; \n how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and \n how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.\n\nAll course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners. New scheduled sessions begin each month. \n\nFor more information about the DeVos Institute's work, visit www.DeVosInstitute.umd.edu. ",

In this project-centered course you will develop your own, original, intellectual property (IP) into a transmedia project containing written versions of your IP on various platforms. You will begin your novel, adapt the first chapters of your novel into the opening scenes of a film or TV show and create a game design concept of your IP. Learner review: \"So much AMAZING information! The teacher and content are wonderful. Learned so much!\"\n\nThis is a course is based in \"Active Learning\" so that most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\nI am a proponent of experiential learning (also known as active learning). My lectures are short and succinct, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a writer. I will guide you, I will show you how to get there, hopefully I will inspire you, but I wont show you how to write or what to write. That is up to you, you are the only one who can illustrate your creative thoughts, by writing them! I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write. You need to unleash your creativity and my plan is to help you to do exactly that!\n\nLearner review: \"This is the most challenging writing course that I have done so far! But, it actually made me write the first two chapters of my novel and now, I am now looking forward to finishing the novel and getting it published.\"\n\nAll of the assignments on this course are peer review. At each stage of the process, whether creating your novel, your screenplay or your video game, you will post your written work and review the works of your peers.  Peer review is an extremely important element of this course. Giving feedback and getting feedback is essential to the development of your critical thinking and your growth as a writer. It is as important as the writing itself.\n\nThis course is designed to tap into your creativity and help you to develop your skills in expressing that creativity through written words.\n\nLearner review: \"It made me stay up to 4AM a few times, but its incredible. You will learn a lot, and it is a very fun class\"\n\nWriting is a truly beautiful, amazing, satisfying thing. Imagine, putting your own words on a page to tell a story which enters your readers minds and allows them to share the thoughts, emotions and lives of your characters. It is a very rewarding experience.\n\nLearner review: \"This course really pushed me to my limits and it is an eye opener for me that there are goals that I can still achieve and accomplish through the world of writing.\" ",

Inferences about causation are of great importance in science, medicine, policy, and business.  This course provides an introduction to the statistical literature on causal inference that has emerged in the last 35-40 years and that has revolutionized the way in which statisticians and applied researchers in many disciplines use data to make inferences about causal relationships.  \n\nWe will study methods for collecting data to estimate causal relationships. Students will learn how to distinguish between relationships that are causal and non-causal; this is not always obvious. We shall then study and evaluate the various methods students can use  such as matching, sub-classification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and machine learning  to estimate a variety of effects  such as the average treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the treated. At the end, we discuss methods for evaluating some of the assumptions we have made, and we offer a look forward to the extensions we take up in the sequel to this course. ",

The course then shows how the three elements can be used to prevent a tragedy when making a personal decision.  \n\nThe rest of the course focuses on making successful business decisions.  In essence, to achieve business and career success, you must create value (strategy) and manage risk (law) in a responsible manner (ethics). \n\nBecause the Law Pillar plays a central role in the three pillar model, the course includes practical legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements of business success.  Specifically, the course shows you how to: \n\n\tattract the best employees, \n\tdevelop successful products, \n\tcreate new business models, \n\tprotect intellectual property, \n\tcreate contracts that achieve business goals, and \n\tuse dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships. \n\nUsing a global perspective, the course also provides an introduction to international business culture for learners from the United States, and an introduction to the U.S. business culture for learners from outside the U.S. ",

This course will teach you to be much less predictable in your thinking and have the confidence and ability to generate unique, workable ideas to solve complex problems. Society impels us to conform to its written and unwritten rules for thinking and behaving in a certain way, which makes too many of the ideas and solutions we generate fairly predictable and ineffective.  The first part of this course is about you. I want to convince you that you were once insanely creative and explain forces around you caused you to lose most of that ability. If you think you are already plenty creative, then know that you're not as creative as you could be and, conversely, if you believe you don't have a single creative bone in your body, I will do my best to convince you you're wrong and share ways you can get your high level of creativity back. \n\nAsking you to think back on some of the societal forces that negatively impacted your upbringing may be hard to hear, but its important to understand these often unseen forces so you can do something to counteract them. \n\nThe second part of the course is for learning several tried and true brainstorming and problem-solving \"tools\" you can use that will help you be your most creative self. \n\n\nPlease note: Portions of this course may include readings, media, and discussion around topics based on emotional experiences from your youth. The title of any element that may be a trigger will be indicated with a \"TW\". ",

        "description": "Instructor:  Hanspeter Schaub   Top Instructor This capstone course is the 3rd and final course of the specialization Advanced Spacecraft Dynamics and Control. It assumes you have completed the prior courses on \"Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices\" and \"Analytical Mechanics for Spacecraft Dynamics\".  This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry. First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.\n\nNext, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time. ",

The general aspects of the photovoltaic field are treated in \"Photovoltaic Solar Energy\". And the detailed description of the crystalline silicon solar cells can be found in \"Physics of Silicon Solar Cells\".\n\nAfter a brief presentation of solar cells operation, thin film semiconductors are described here. The general properties of disordered and crystalline semiconductors are found very different, in particular in terms of band structure and doping mechanisms. Silicon thin films, generally less than 1 m thick, are deposited from silane plasma leading to hydrogen incorporation. The growth mechanisms are discussed, in particular the capability to prepare partially crystallized thin films which appear as a mixture of nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous tissue.\n\nThe consequences of the semiconductor properties on solar cells behavior are reviewed. The optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon are complementary. Thus the plasma process is particularly well adapted to the preparation of multijunctions, with conversion efficiencies around 13-15 %. Furthermore plasma processes allow to prepare solar cells in large area on glass or flexible substrates.\n\nFinally, it is shown that crystalline and amorphous silicon materials can be combine into heterojunctions solar cells with high efficiency conversion (about 25 %).\n\n**This course is part of a series of 3**\nPhotovoltaic solar energy (https://www.coursera.org/learn/photovoltaic-solar-energy/)\nPhysics of silicon solar cells (https://www.coursera.org/learn/physics-silicon-solar-cells/)\nSilicon thin film solar cells ",

Learn and practice concepts, techniques, and get to grips with the latest thinking on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. Analyze how firms attempt to capture value, as well as profits, in the revenues they earn.  Along this course, you will learn pricing strategy key concepts such as pricing psychology, price discrimination, willingness to pay of customers, optimal price and price elasticity. This course has an additional focus on pricing dynamics and the reaction to and by competitors, taking a highly pragmatic approach and one that is directly applicable to your day-to-day professional life.\n\nAfter this course, you will be able to contribute to the process of formulating pricing strategies for your own products and services, or those of your firm.\n\nMartin Boehm - IE Professor and Dean of the Business School with over 10 years experience - will guide you through four modules.  We begin with the importance of pricing and how it ultimately can affect the bottom line.  Then, we move on to methods to help you decide what is the optimal price for your product; and then price discrimination - should all your products follow the same pricing strategy or should you differentiate depending on the customer segment?  Finally, we look at pricing psychology and how you can influence customers in order to drive the highest possible price for your product. ",

This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms. This capstone is valuable for anyone who is planning on using RL to solve real problems. To be successful in this course, you will need to have completed Courses 1, 2, and 3 of this Specialization or the equivalent.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: \n\nComplete an RL solution to a problem, starting from problem formulation, appropriate algorithm selection and implementation and empirical study into the effectiveness of the solution.

The course provides a quick refresher on top level math and statistics concepts that will be used throughout the MBA curriculum at any school. All of the concepts will be reinforced with practical real-world examples. All calculations, formulas, and data analysis will be performed in Excel, with many detailed demonstrations. For those unfamiliar or less comfortable with spreadsheets, the course will also prepare students with a basic facility for using spreadsheets to solve quantitative business problems.

It can be used for self-care, to help co-workers with stress reactions, or to help someone seek other types of support. Stress First Aid is a framework of practical actions that can help reduce the likelihood that stress reactions will develop into more severe or long-term problems. Ideally everyone in an organization would learn the vocabulary and basics of Stress First Aid, to share a language and understanding of stress and stress injury. When everyone in an organization is trained in SFA, support could occur wherever and whenever its needed. ",

This course focuses on the all-important problem of perception.  We first describe the problem of tracking objects in complex scenes. We look at two key challenges in this context. The first is the separation of an image into object and background using a technique called change detection. The second is the tracking of one or more objects in a video. Next, we examine the problem of segmenting an image into meaningful regions. In particular, we take a bottom-up approach where pixels with similar attributes are grouped together to obtain a region. \n\nFinally, we tackle the problem of object recognition. We describe two approaches to the problem. The first directly recognize an object and its pose using the appearance of the object. This method is based on the concept of dimension reduction, which is achieved using principal component analysis. The second approach is to use a neural network to solve the recognition problem as one of learning a mapping from the input (image) to the output (object class, object identity, activity, etc.). We describe how a neural network is constructed and how it is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. ",

Carter Michigan State University 6 Courses  93,440 learners OK This course is the last course in this specialization before its capstone experience where you, the learner will launch your business. Consider all the activities associated with the final preparation for a NASA launch before the final countdown takes place. Those are the type of activities with respect to launching a business that will be covered in this course. The goal of the course is for you to have a document that details all the actions you need to take, and all the things that you need to think about before launching your business, with instructions on how to do those actions and how to thing about those things.  Specifically the course will provide you with five benefits or outcomes. First your attitude will be finely focused and tuned to the mindset concepts covered in course one that are likely to have the greatest impact on your business launch. Second in a similar fashion you will become keenly aware of those aspects of your business that directly impact its ability to create and deliver value on day one; and have actions plans to address each aspect. With your 'mind right' and your 'business right' the third and fourth outcomes of the course are actions plans to get your 'market connections' right. The course will allow you to explore strategies and tactics to engage the market, communication your message, and generate sales; and select those which give you the best opportunity to learn and establish a foundation for growth. Finally the course will walk you through a final checklist of operational issues that will allow you to enter the capstone course and your business launch ready to go on day one.\n\nThroughout the course we have emphasized the importance of market engagement, allowing the market to provide feedback that sharpens your business and maximizes its chances for success. As with the entire specialization the feedback you will get through the peer review assignments for this course and the capstone course are an invaluable opportunity for for such engagement. ",

        "description": "Instructor:  Beth Simon   How can students learn about abstraction by creating a movie scene?  Or make an interactive map using lists?  You'll learn (and do it yourself) in this course! This class teaches the concepts of abstraction (methods and parameters) and lists.  For each concept, we'll start by helping you connect real-world experiences you are already familiar with to the programming concept you are about to learn.  Next, through a cognitively scaffolded process we'll engage you in developing your fluency with problem solving with abstraction and lists in a way that keeps frustration at a minimum.  \n\nAlong the way you will learn about the common challenges or \"bugs\" students have with these concepts as well as ways to help them find and fix those concepts.  You'll also be guided in running classroom discussions to help students develop deeper understanding of these concepts.\n\nFinally, you'll learn about the importance and logistics of assigning creative, student-designed programming projects. \nAdditionally, you will create a personal plan for increasing your skills in supporting a culturally responsive learning environment in your classroom.

Hence you will be able to develop a method to evaluate the social mission that you achieve while implementing your business plan. Next you will outline an appropriate communication strategy for your social enterprise and will demonstrate how to market your products and services to beneficiaries and other customers. Here you will employ an adaptable communication strategy as you move from early adopters to a broader market share.  Furthermore you will determine growth strategies and how you can scale or replicate your business plan internationally in order to reach a larger number of beneficiaries. In particular you will discuss organic growth, social franchising, and an open source approach. Finally, you will evaluate exit strategies. Thus you will review options social enterprises have when they need to finance their growth but the original funders can not or do not want to finance the expansion. \n\nCourse 3 will be completed by your Capstone project, which will ask you to submit the final business plan of your social venture.\n\nNote: It is highly recommended to have completed Course 1 & 2 of the Social Entrepreneurship Specialization before starting this Course!

        "description": "Archaeology is, among human sciences, the discipline with the strongest importance for the rediscovery, but also for the preservation and protection of cultural heritage, as Humankinds universal patrimony. You will be introduced to the way we ourselves reflect on and are engaged with the study of human past: from the practical and material recovery of ancient traces in the field to the study and interpretation. On the other hand, the discovery of human past implies the correct conservation and presentation for both experts and general public: the study and protection of the past we share every day prevent from any possible destruction, misuse, abuse and thus cancellation of human memory. Recovering the Humankind's Past and Saving the Universal Heritage presents to a large public Archaeology as a historical discipline: through an inter-disciplinary perspective you will follow the evolution and change of archaeology to the moment when natural sciences contributed to make the historical reconstructions scientifically sound; the aid of informatics and of virtual reconstructions gives new fascination to the already strong suggestion of Archaeology, as the discipline of discovery par excellence. Within this frame, Ebla, which is the glory of the Sapienza school of Oriental archaeology, will have an exemplary meaning in the course development as a long lasting experience on the field and an excellent example of the scientific results of combined researches and disciplines.\n\nMoreover, the course will focus on actual, innovative instruments to preserve, monitor and give value to cultural heritage through a multidisciplinary approach, based on a deep archaeological and historical knowledge but also on ICT technologies. The wide adoption of ICT technologies in our daily life is also impacting in the way in which we interact with our cultural heritage in particular in terms of preservation and dissemination of cultural objects.\n\nIn this course you will  learn the basic techniques  to digitize cultural objects and obtain 3D digital copies of a physical objects such as statues, vases or archaeological sites.  We will also discuss how to structure the raw data in order to facilitate and make effective the access to digital contents. In particular, we will present the European Data Model, a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe.

Este curso permitira no solo exponer a los participantes a todos los detalles del proceso de decision tipicos del gerente de finanzas, sino aplicar sus conocimientos a un caso concreto. El proceso comienza con un analisis historico de la informacion financiera que luego de usa para la construccion de una tabla de supuestos donde se resumen todas las estimaciones. Luego, basados en esa tabla de supuestos, se construye un modelo proyectado sobre el cual se estima el Valor Presente Neto usando el WACC o costo de oportunidad del capital invertido. Sobre ese caso base, se realiza un analisis de riesgo basado en un analisis de sensibilidad, un analisis de punto de equilibrio y un analisis de escenarios. Con toda esta informacion, el analista estara listo para tomar una buena decision financiera. Este curso esta orientado a personas que tienen alguna experiencia contable, pero poca experiencia como analistas financieros o les falta comprension global de las finanzas. Por ejemplo, asistentes de finanzas que apoyan el rol de la gerencia de finanzas o gerentes de finanzas con poca experiencia que, aunque no tendran la responsabilidad de realizar cada una de las tareas, quieren conocer el contexto y el proceso globalmente.

        "description": "Doing philosophy is like seeing a movie and wondering what will happen next, or what you would do in the same situation, or whats real and whats merely make-believe. Youre probably not aware of it, but since you already know how to see movies and use your imagination, youre well on your way to becoming a good philosopher. The only thing you still need and want to develop though, is the ability to use your imagination in the philosophical way, and thats exactly what youll learn in this MOOC.\n\nFirstly, youll learn how to use your imagination to put definitions, analyses or conceptions of philosophically relevant notions to the test by means of imaginary examples and counterexamples, addressing questions that have been part and parcel of Western philosophy since its very inception, such as \n- what is knowledge?;\n- what is the mind?;\n- what is moral responsibility?; and\n- what is justice?.\n\nSubsequently, youll learn how to use your imagination to develop your worldview. Youll learn to speculate about what might explain your experiences, ranging from the commonsense explanation in terms of a mind-independent world, to sceptical alternatives, such as that youre systematically misled by an evil demon or that only your mind exists and that it confabulates all the rest.\n\nFinally, since philosophy is not only about interpreting the world, but also about changing it -and hopefully, for the better- youll also learn how to use your imagination to evaluate what the right thing to do is in a given situation, what the criteria are to evaluate actions, and whether such criteria are established evermore or remain an open question.

That journey continues even today and we call it the Kennedy legacy.  This course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how JFKs life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.\n\nUnderstanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.    \n    \nNovember 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedys words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedys influence persist, and will it continue? What are the effects? \n\nWell address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century. \n\nFollow on Twitter: @JFKclass.

Those who complete the course will: create examples of systems parts, boundaries, and behaviors related to sustainability (and soccer/football); practice evaluating the sustainability of systems they care about using several complementary methods; generate ideas to improve the sustainability of a system they care about; and explain a mindset shift that would enhance the sustainability of a system they care about.

Then youll learn to use energy (kinetic, potential) instead of forces to describe the same physics. Finally, we dive into more complicated topics such as angular momentum, torque, and rotational dynamics and end the series with a mathematical description of simple harmonic motion and use that to approximate the simple pendulum and other cases where we can approximate the potential function as a quadratic.\r\n \r\n This series of courses requires the use of calculus, but many of the concepts will be reviewed as needed.

Por ejemplo, una ecuacion con 3 letras fue suficiente para que Einstein plasmara la teoria de la relatividad especial sin la cual no comprenderiamos varios aspectos del universo en el que vivimos. Por otro lado, dominar a plenitud el algebra es fundamental para poder estudiar topicos mas avanzados en matematica como trigonometria, geometria, calculo y estadistica; cursos requeridos en cualquier carrera profesional en areas STEM. De alli la importancia de contar con un solido conocimiento de algebra elemental, topico central de este programa. \r\n\r\n Para poder estudiar el lenguaje algebraico y sobre todo para comprenderlo a fondo es necesario sembrar bien los pilares que le sostienen. Es por ello que, en esta secuencia de cursos, iniciaras por repasar y consolidar las nociones fundamentales de la aritmetica en los numeros reales. En el segundo curso, aprenderas el concepto de expresion algebraica y a realizar operaciones fundamentales entre ellas. Finalmente, en el tercer curso, aprenderas a modelar y resolver problemas de aplicacion\r\nen diversos contextos utilizando ecuaciones y desigualdades. \r\n\r\n En cada curso te encontraras con una gran cantidad de ejemplos resueltos y por supuesto con una amplia gama de problemas, ejercicios y retos que te ayudaran no solo a comprender el tema en cuestion sino tambien a medir tu progreso semanal. A pesar de ser un programa introductorio, cada uno de los temas se desarrolla con el rigor matematico necesario para fundamentar los resultados y herramientas a aplicar, para que asi comprendas lo que estas haciendo y diste de un enfoque memoristico sin sentido. De esta manera, este programa te llevara paso a paso en el estudio del algebra y desarrollara en ti las competencias necesarias para estudiar topicos mas avanzados en matematica, fortaleciendo a la vez tu pensamiento logico y estructurado.

        "description": "This program offers knowledge, skills, and support to become a more compassionate, mindful, healthy helper. Social workers often work with clients that are in crisis or have experienced trauma or are experiencing trauma and stress in the present. Its necessary to understand what trauma is, know the impacts of trauma, and what the social work profession and other professions are doing to work effectively with individuals, groups, families and communities that have been traumatized. Trauma is widespread and crosses all socioeconomic, racial, and geographic boundaries. Social workers often come to the profession because of something traumatic they have experienced in their life which has led them to want to help others experiencing trauma. It's important for social workers to understand how to work effectively with individuals, families and communities that have experienced trauma both historically and currently. \r\n\r\n Social workers and helpers have an ethical responsibility to practice self-awareness, to explore how their own historical or current experiences impact their worldview and behavior. It is also essential to learn about, cultivate, and practice self-care as we do good work with others to ensure that we do no harm to ourselves or those we help. The concept of wellness is weaved throughout these courses and is looked at as a life-long journey that we are all on, both individually and collectively. Wellness is about health, healing, growth, reflection, connection, relationships, awareness, practice, and much more. Each week students will have an opportunity to practice wellness tools and reflect on the material for the week. The material might hit close to home, may be emotional or overwhelming to read about or watch or talk about. It is important to cultivate wellness tools so that we dont get stuck in trauma, grief, or feel overwhelmed by the challenges that life sometimes throws at us. On the flip side this program is also likely to inspire you and uplift you as we learn about the strength and resilience of the human spirit. \r\n\r\n Created by an Indigenous Deg Xitan scholar, professor of social work, and national trainer on healing centered engagement, wellness, and resilience, this certificate program will guide you toward being a more compassionate, mindful, healthy helper.

To prevent irreversible damage to human societies and the environment, it was agreed that world countries should limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 C or even to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. \r\n\r\n But where to start, and how to take action? \r\n\r\n This 4-course program is designed for the next generation of policy-makers, sustainability consultants or professionals and students from various fields who want to obtain basic knowledge about climate change and to get an overview of mitigation strategies in various industries and organizations. It will provide you with knowledge and basic skills and tools to design a concrete action plan to make your organization climate-neutral.  \r\n\r\n In the first three courses, you will get insights into the what and how of greenhouse gas emission reductions: what are technologies and behavioural changes that are effective, how to analyze their potential, cost-effectiveness and feasibility, and which policies and strategies can be used to implement them. In the fourth course, you will integrate those insights into action and learn to define targets and develop a feasible action plan for an organization to reduce its carbon footprint and become climate-neutral.  \r\n\r\n We invite you to join this journey, bring your own experiences and challenges and to discuss these with like-minded peers who want to tackle humanitys greatest challenge just like you!

        "description": "Todays organizations find themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace. As competitors move fast and consumer demands evolve faster than ever before, the ability and willingness to be agile is critical but not sufficient. \r\n\r\n Organizations need an enterprise capability to constantly define their purpose (the why) and focus (the what) at all levels to maximize value creation and delivery. \r\n\r\n Product management practices build unprecedented discipline during the course of building a successful product. Teams constantly evaluate who they are building for, what they should build, and why they should build it. Developing a clear understanding of these aspects (the who, the what and the why) prior to undertaking the expensive build process ensures two critical outcomes - that an organizations limited resources are constantly aligned to delivering highest value, and\r\nthe output aligns with what the customers are looking for, thereby ensuring product success. \r\n\r\n We start with building a deep understanding of the customer focusing on a single product throughout its product life cycle in the first course. We build up on this approach by introducing related product offerings. This allows for managers to envision their programs and teams working in a diverse product portfolio using Lean principles.  \r\n\r\n Building on that understanding of the product portfolio, we pursue an understanding of what a Product Enterprise is, why it makes sense to build one and how to get there. This second course lays the conceptual groundwork that enables achieving the vision of a customer-centric value creation business model centered around lean principles.  \r\n\r\n Finally, the capstone course lays out the details of building out a scaled product enterprise thats customer-centric, and explores alignment of organizational support functions with a scaled product framework that lays the pathway for a sustainable value maximizing enterprise at scale. \r\n\r\n In summary, this certificate will help you build a product enterprise through lean product portfolio management. It will build up on core lean principles to help create scalable internal alignment to uncover and deliver highest value opportunities on a continuous basis. ",

        "description": "The study of neuroscience includes many branches, including neuropsychology, molecular neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral neuroscience, among many others. Expand your biomedical research expertise by learning how to use mouse behaviors to study psychiatric disorders in humans. Before research is conducted to understand the human brain, cognition, and the nervous system, studies often first use mice because of the similarities in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neurobiology. By studying brain function in mice, we gain insight into how the human brain works.  \r\n\r\n Enhance your knowledge of mental health conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression in humans and animals, and the role of animal models and animal behavior in studying human behavior and psychiatric disorders by comparing and contrasting human and mouse behavior.\r\nCreated by Professor Abel Bult-Ito at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, this certificate program, helps you obtain the skills you need to succeed in the biomedical research field by covering the fundamentals of behavioral neuroscience research. Enrollment in the certificate program includes three online neuroscience courses that focus on research using mice and mental health conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and anxiety. Behavioral health, such as the treatment of psychiatric disorders and prevention of suicide, is still one of the biggest challenges in medicine and healthcare today and will continue to be a top priority for scientific research. \r\n\r\n By completing these online courses, youll have learned responsible conduct of research in behavioral neuroscience; collected, analyzed, and interpreted behavioral data from mice; critically evaluated the use of different behavioral tests in mice; and established a foundation in using behavioral tests in rodents.

They are incredibly powerful and have disrupted the world in the last years, especially with attacks like Meltdown and Spectre that impacted most computers on the planet. You  have also likely seen side channels and used them already yourself. \r\n \r\n In this program, consisting of two courses, you will learn and practice the side-channel mindset , understand how to spot side channels in the real-world and how to use them in non-technical and semi-technical settings. The first course will provide you with the ability to spot side channels and the security problems they introduce in your job, research, studies, and in everyday life. In both courses, you will solve simple exercises using side channels in the real world and on computer systems to practically apply the acquired skills. \r\n\r\n The first course requires no programming skills and has an entirely web-based exercise. In the second course, you will need basic programming skills (reading C code is required).  We will provide you with all basics beyond that, including basics on operating systems, computer architecture, cryptography, and most importantly side-channel analysis. You will learn and practice how basic software-based side channels work and how you can mitigate them to protect yourself as well as the hardware and software you develop. We will provide you with Docker containers (and a tutorial on how to use them), to run the exercises on your own computer. \r\n \r\n Daniel Gruss is a internationally renowned expert in side-channel research and has written many seminal works in this field and presented them at renowned international conferences, especially on transient-execution attacks that affected the entire industry and defenses that have been implemented in all operating systems.

Only through integrated information technology systems designed for business analytics can companies sense and respond to changing market demands.   \r\n\r\n Business agility demands a digital enterprise.   \r\n\r\n Digital technologies have the potential to transform organizations into lean, agile businesses that are strongly focused on their customers. But, just introducing digital technologies into an enterprise is not enough. Without the right organizational culture, business processes, and active people training, you will not realize the full value of digital technologies.   \r\n\r\n In this program, we help you see the dynamic capabilities of your organization. Using the fitness landscape model we help managers see where they are in relation to other organizations and how to reconfigure their dynamic capabilities to move higher up the competitive fitness landscape.  \r\n\r\n These dynamic capabilities include both the social and the digital - how we work and the technologies that support it.. Terabytes of processing and machine learning wont be the solution to your business problems on their own. As companies pursue big data and cloud computing strategies to improve their decision making with actionable insights - the technologies will change. To truly sustainably improve the customer experience and achieve the competitive advantage that the power of data promises, you need the social technologies and processes that are able to adapt along with your data strategy.    \r\n\r\n This ability to reconfigure and deploy new capabilities within the organization by creating, extending, or modifying the existing resources is a dynamic capability. With the speed of technology disruption, business leaders must enable their company to adapt.  \r\n\r\n This certificate will also teach you about how to discover data sources in your company, and leverage those structured and unstructured data to improve your whole business. From supply chain sourcing to marketing and delivery.  \r\n\r\n These lessons will help you make the right choices about digital transformation to make your organization better fulfill its mission and delight customers. To get there you must first understand the vision of a digital enterprise, what it looks like, how it operates, and why its so powerful in delivering results. ",

Implementing algorithmic techniques that efficiently manipulate data structures is the essence of this program.  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Data Structures and Algorithms Professional Certificate from GTx is a four-course series covering the foundations of data structures, and designing efficient algorithms. The learner will examine and implement the principles of data storage in low-level data structures such as LinkedLists, Stacks and Queues. The learner will understand the significance of Abstract Data Types (ADTs). The fundamentals of recursion, edge cases, and algorithmic efficiency are emphasized throughout the four-course series. The series transitions from linear data structures to nonlinear data structures. The learner will explore Binary Search Trees (BSTs), HashMaps and Heaps. Implementations of the depth-first search (dfs) and breadth-first search (bfs) traversal algorithms are presented. Higher order data structures, like AVL and 2-4 trees, delves into self-balancing algorithmic techniques. Computer scientists must have a thorough understanding of time complexity in order to write efficient algorithms. The 3rd & 4th courses focus on efficiency by first reviewing iterative sorting algorithms, bubble sort, and then implementing optimizations applied the sorting algorithm which improves performance. Divide and conquer algorithms, such as merge sort, quicksort and radix sort, are explained. The series wraps up with the graph ADT that utilizes many lower level data structures as auxiliary data storage in order to implement Dijkstras shortest path and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. \r\n\r\n Georgia Techs undergraduate computer science program is ranked #5 in U.S. The Professional Certificate for this program uses the same instructional materials and assessments as this on-campus accredited CS 1332 course, giving you a Georgia Tech-caliber learning experience with data structures & algorithms in computing. The Data Structures and Algorithms series of courses uses the Java object-oriented programming language which remains one of the most popular languages among software developers. Short (3-5 minute) videos and visualization exploratory labs are just part of the instructional tools used to deliver the content in this program. Students completing this program exit with the same learning outcomes as the traditional Georgia Tech on-campus course. ",

Even if you have a team of full stack developers, they are faced with the fact that infrastructure needs to be established before the first line of hand-coding can be written. Now what about low-code applications vs traditional-coding?  (Building apps using Drag-and Drop tools or excel being examples) \r\n\r\n To respond to this challenge, Low Code/No Code (LC/NC)platforms are selected to meet a business need.  However, during the platform selection process, the platform's go to market team promises their platform will solve all of your business problems, and while this may be true it isnt without effort, and it is rarely seamless.  As the business representative to the platform, it is your duty to understand how this system will impact your business, where the gaps are and if you will be able to adjust your business processes to meet the business processes of the platform selected.  Understanding your business is half of the challenge, understanding your platform is just as important. \r\n   \r\n During this course the student will go through a full Low Code/No Code platform lifecycle.  Learners will get an understanding of how to lead Citizen Developers (CD) and learn how to deploy solutions that will deliver success.  This 3-course program has modules that will guide students through the workflow and processes of building an enterprise solution in a Low Code/No Code environment with the aid of templates.  By the end, students will have done some low-code app development without the need of prior coding experience or programming language. The end result being the following deliverables:\r\n \r\n An analysis of the development environment, business users and the solution where they want to build an enterprise application. \r\n A strategic plan to deliver and build a visual model of their desired solution. \r\n A fully functional application on the platform of their choosing. (An example being a new mobile app). \r\n An enterprise-grade change management solution and road map for the future of their custom application. \r\n \r\n\r\n On top of learning new applications, we want to provide a deeper understanding of the benefits of low-code vs no-code development, low-code tools, low-code application platforms, low-code application development, and the user interface.\r\n\r\n As part of this certification class, we will review the following Low Code/No Code platforms:\r\n \r\n Service Now \r\n Appian \r\n OutSystems \r\n Mendix \r\n Salesforce \r\n Zoho \r\n App Sheets \r\n \r\n\r\n This is just a sampling of platforms we will cover.

The real-world examples provide a modern interpretation of how initiatives, including sustainability and technology adaptation, drive current Global Value Chains and their envisioned process and continuous improvement. \r\n\r\n It is recommended the three-course program be taken in sequence. It guides learners through concepts and foundations of Quality, along with the use of both the basics, as well as the advanced, improvement tools and techniques to show the integration of lean to six sigma. \r\n\r\n The program begins with CLSSYB01: Introduction to Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chains, guiding learners through the basic Six Sigma Methodology and foundations of Six Sigma and Supply Chain Management. CLSSYB01 provides an understanding of various topics starting with an introduction and overview of Six Sigma. The course will advance into DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) and its related six sigma tools. Learners will gain an understanding of the Lean in Six Sigma before moving into the roles and responsibilities of management and stakeholders within Lean Six Sigma in Supply Chain. \r\n\r\n After completing CLSSYB01, learners are encouraged to continue with CLSSYB02 and CLSSYB03 in order to obtain the Lean Six Sigma Certificate and gain further understanding on how to implement Lean Six Sigma Projects for optimization of supply chain and strong sustainability performance. \r\n\r\n The Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable Supply Chain Program includes a second content course: CLSSYB02: Lean Six Sigma Program and Project Management, which expands upon the content of CLSSYB01. \r\n\r\n Within CLSSYB02, the learner is taken through the applied use of the tools and metrics in the LSS program framework. This applied approach includes the basics of project management and lays out real-world methods to apply these tools at the basic level. This program prepares the learner with the necessary knowledge to be a team member (Yellow Belt) of LSS projects seeking synergies, product quality improvement, reduced variability, and shorter lead times. \r\n \r\n The final course is a certification exam. CLSSYB03: ISCEA CLSSYB Exam, allows learners to display their knowledge acquired in the previous courses of the ISCEA Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable Supply Chain Program. If the program is successfully completed, the learner will obtain a credential recognized by the industry that supports improved workforce options for the learner: The Certified Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt Designation.  \r\n \r\n While there are no enforced prerequisites to participate in the program, the Lean Six Sigma for Sustainable Supply Chain Program, on edX by ISCEA, is recommended for pre-career or early career Supply Chain professionals. Previous experience in, or future plans to enter into the areas of merchandising, inventory management, operations management, manufacturing industries, the production process, decision making, or buyer/planner role, complements the expertise gained via completion of the courses. ISCEA envisions learners who are seeking tangible skills, tutorials, and credentials to facilitate their progress into senior roles with more strategic oversight, to be successful candidates for the program. Learners who complete the program can immediately apply the lessons they learn to corporate roles and related value streams. Those focused on corporate process improvement, reduced environmental impact efforts, and customer satisfaction will receive great benefits from this program. There is limited mathematical expectations within the courses of the program. ",

        "description": "Setting a clear vision is essential for leaders in any organization, as it helps to guide decision-making and inspires employees and stakeholders to work towards common goals. Strategic planning leaders struggle with envisioning the future and may not have the skills to effectively communicate their vision. Senior leadership must then create action plans that elevate the strategic planning document so that all stakeholders are aligned. Strategy development matters only as much as it can be successfully executed. If you are considering a strategic planning process, you must be conscious of the interface between vision and execution. \r\n \r\n The business environment is changing quickly as new technologies, risks and opportunities present themselves. Companies without strategic foresight and long-term vision capabilities will remain in reactive modes. Strategy formulation is not enough to withstand shocks. Strategists must commit time for reflective thinking and away from the day to day in order to scan the external environment and discover what the convergence of trends, demographics threats, and opportunities means for successful strategic planning. \r\n\r\n Research shows that less than 10% of leaders consider themselves to be visionary and few think long-term about all stakeholders and their needs. This is a problem, as employees, product management teams, project managers and other stakeholders want to be part of a company with bold, clear strategic goals and strategic objectives that are ignited by a clearly described future state. The why movement linked to crafting purpose and organizations mission statements is now being supplanted by the emerging where movement. This movement goes beyond brainstorming towards declaring the big ideas tied to long term goals that will inspire stakeholders and create a competitive advantage. Where are we going? as an organization is the primal question posed by employees that CEOs and product managers must smartly address. This program will show you how. \r\n\r\n Furthermore, the rise of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investors and stakeholders has increased the pressure on companies to take a longer-term view and link their vision to sustainable measures that delight a broad set of stakeholders. \r\n\r\n As leaders pivot from the vision towards strategy execution, they are then met with either resistance or lift as organizational architecture and economics bring realism against the aspiration. Operational plans must confront and align their 4 pillars that will enable leaders to execute the organizations goals or wind up frustrated by the inertia that they create. The 4-pillar methodology delivers a strategic framework that makes the linkage between:\r\n \r\n Performance measurement and goal setting (OKRs or KPIs) \r\n Establishing team structures, organization charts and empowerment \r\n Rewards, punishments and incentives, and \r\n Corporate culture (norms, values, behaviors and assumptions). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n One example of a leader who successfully applied this strategic framework is CEO Satya Nadella of Microsoft. By focusing on these four pillars, he was able to transform the organizations mission and pursue new opportunities that led Microsoft to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Too often leaders simply change an element of culture or a piece of performance evaluation and there is a breakdown as they must look at all four pillars simultaneously. Nadella reset Microsofts business model and strategy as he optimized the four pillars against a strategy map that helped all employees know what mattered the most. Once in place, Microsoft began to unleash an effective product strategy chasing new time frames that routinely encourages product plans that are bold with outstanding user experiences. \r\n\r\n The program will also dissect cases like Wells Fargo where the business strategy and 4 pillars were misaligned and drove young employees to promote opening accounts with disastrous results for consumers and shareholders. \r\n\r\n This two-part course will make the connection between a long-term vision and strategic planning driven by the CEO and C-suite and the translation down to product design teams and project managers who live in day-to-day execution. By reinforcing mechanisms that drive constructive behaviors, the course will help leaders turn their big ideas into practical, tangible products. In doing so, it will make the power of vision more accessible and help leaders to create value for all stakeholders. By focusing on long-term vision (and exploring cathedral and multi-generational thinking) and clearly communicating it through concrete language, imagery, initiatives and storytelling, CEOs and founders as well as the product managers can set their organization apart and unite their people towards a common, achievable future. This course will teach how your business plan and business goals can be elevated by vision (big ideas) and executed through the proper alignment and reinforcement mechanisms within the 4 pillars. ",

        "description": "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming With Java is a series of courses built from Georgia Techs online for-credit version of CS1331: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  \r\n\r\n This course begins with an introduction to the Java programming language. It provides a brief history of Java and presents the foundations of what set it apart from the programming languages (procedural and object-oriented) that existed at the time of its creation. Students will then learn the basics of Java syntax and explore writing interactive programs that incorporate concepts and constructs like: primitive data types, classes, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, arrays, console input and output, methods, and reuse. \r\n\r\n Following this introduction, students will begin hands-on learning about object-oriented programming.  They'll write their own custom classes that represent real-world concepts and objects and learn how to organize different (built-in and custom) classes into a programming solution. \r\n\r\n Students will then extend their understanding of reusability with an introduction to inheritance and explore topics like parent-child class (or subclass-super-class) relationships, abstract classes, and UML.  \r\n\r\n Next, students will learn about interfaces and polymorphism.  Intertwined in that discussion is a mini-lesson on the kinds of algorithms that are often used to process data in programs and how one might use them in an OOP context. Students will also learn the basics of evaluating algorithms based on the concept of runtime complexity.  Such a skill can ultimately make them better programmers. \r\n\r\n Along those lines, students will improve their approach to handling runtime errors by learning about exceptions.  They will apply the construct in multiple contexts, including file input and output. \r\n\r\n The course series concludes by presenting the fundamentals of a few advanced topics, namely: data structures (primarily lists), recursion, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with JavaFX, anonymous inner classes, and lambda expressions.

        "description": "Our education and professional experiences focus on technical, how to do it, skills. So, we progress from doer to manager to leader, primarily based on our technical competencies. This model of promotion has been in use for decades, but it is now obsolete. Few of us intentionally learn soft skills along the way, finding ourselves a bit overwhelmed when asked to work in complex teams or to assume a managerial or leadership role. \r\n\r\n Employers have recognized the value of personality type, adaptability and flexibility in responding to change, emotional intelligence, trust, psychological safety, conflict management and the ability to manage time, stress and energy to meet organizational needs. None of these are technical skills. They are the soft skills, probably the most difficult skills to assess and learn  but critical to professional, and life, success. In fact, they are now being renamed Power Skills. Do you have what you need to succeed? \r\n\r\n This certificate offers an extraordinary opportunity to spend some quality time with yourself to assess your current level of soft skills, clearly define your core self, and build soft skills which are essential to professional, not to mention life, success. \r\n\r\n In this certificate program, you will consider what makes a positive workplace where people can do their best; assess who you are now and set goals for who youd like to become, emotions and emotional intelligence, strengths, personality type, and values-based decision-making, a key to critical thinking.

Become the person ready to take the next step with all the right power skills. \r\n\r\n How will this happen?

You will also learn the trade-offs of using hybrid techniques such as Lean Startup, Scaled Agile For the Enterprise (SAFe), and Disciplined Agile Development.  \r\n\r\n We will then go beyond these frameworks to the science and essential principles youll need to ensure you get the greatest benefits of Agile Project Management methods: Speed, Innovation, Leadership, and Kaizen (Change for the Better). \r\n\r\n After completing this course series, you will be able to clearly explain how Agile techniques address faults in traditional project management techniques, the tradeoffs (benefits and risks) of these approaches, and when its best to apply them to maximize value to the organization. \r\n\r\n Engineers, managers, designers, writers, creators, and executers of all types will benefit from learning these principles of Agile. Whether youre delivering a small part of a project or portfolios of large multi-million-dollar government works; these principles scale and apply to all industries to achieve delivery success. This is why companies that are embracing these principles continue to set record earnings and stock prices (e.g. AMZN, APPL, TSLA); and those that ignore them find themselves unable to compete. \r\n\r\n Upon successful completion of this program, learners can earn up to 50 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, 10 PDU credits per course, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).  PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).  ",

Asi, se efectua un abordaje del contenido normativo internacional que regula las cuestiones presentadas en los temarios y en algunos casos, se hace alusion a la normativa interna colombiana como ejemplo para ilustrar estudios de caso. Lo anterior, permite generar un conocimiento aplicado sobre temas como igualdad, no discriminacion, justicia transicional, litigio estrategico, derechos de las victimas, bioetica y debates relacionados con esto, asi como, la movilidad humana, derechos de los migrantes, migracion internacional, refugio, apatrida, entre otros. \r\n\r\n Con esto, es posible hallar aproximaciones de alcance global que a partir del desarrollo normativo y la interpretacion realizada por parte de los organos de los tratados, se acercan al tratamiento de derechos ya consolidados, como el marco aplicable a las personas en situacion de movilidad humana y derechos geneticos, asi como tambien, al abordaje de categorias y derechos como el olvido, la memoria historica, la reparacion de las victimas, etc. \r\n\r\n El micromaster puede ser cursado por lideres sociales, abogados especializados en derechos humanos, trabajadores de organizaciones no gubernamentales, miembros de organizaciones internacionales, funcionarios publicos, internacionalistas, profesionales en humanidades o ciencias afines, docentes, profesionales de la salud, politologos, o cualquier profesional interesado en conocer sobre la proteccion de derechos humanos. \r\n\r\n Entre los temas conviene destacar cuestiones relacionadas con el alcance de la dignidad humana, la igualdad y no discriminacion, el acceso a derechos civiles y politicos, asi como derechos sociales, economicos y culturales de poblacion vulnerable, como sucede con las personas en situacion de movilidad, asi tambien se estudian, las violaciones de derechos humanos, y los mecanismos de proteccion de los derechos humanos por via del litigio estrategico. Por su parte, tambien abarca cuestiones relacionadas con la importancia de la justicia, los derechos de las victimas, la justicia transicional, e instituciones fundamentales como las comisiones de la verdad y su papel en las sociedades democraticas. Por ultimo, se hace una aproximacion al tema de los derechos emergentes que se relacionan con la bioetica y el bio-derecho. ",

        "description": "Addressing global challenges such as climate change, the decline of biodiversity and the violation of human rights is high on the agenda of international organizations, universities, non-governmental organizations and companies and stands at the core of the concept of sustainable development.  The key importance of sustainable development has also been recognized in the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which also underlines the tradeoffs between global sustainability goals. Many global governance instruments have been developed and aim to tackle these challenges. In particular, international trade plays an important role both as perpetrator of global sustainability challenges and as a tool to address them. \r\n\r\n This program provides an in-depth introduction into the Sustainable Development Goals and the key institutions established to address global sustainability challenges. Through 3 courses, you will learn what the key sustainability challenges are, how they can be addressed, which trade-offs exist in addressing sustainability challenges, which challenges emerge with the implementation of policies to address sustainability challenges and how to analyze the effectiveness of the many global governance instruments that are available to tackle global challenges, with a specific focus on international trade policy instruments. \r\n\r\n You will acquire knowledge on these topics, get access to cutting edge reports and other sources such as webinars and hear from leading academics and practitioners. In total, the professional certificate gathers the insights from more than 25 experts. Academic experts come from a wide range of disciplines relevant to addressing sustainability challenges including law, political science, economics and bio-engineering. You will also learn from practitioners and policy-makers from the local to the global level. \r\n\r\n The program is designed to empower critical and results-driven thinking that can be applied in the different types of organizations. \r\n\r\n This professional certificate will give you a leading edge if you want to pursue a career in sustainable development either as a civil servant or policy advisor in national and international organizations, a campaigner for an NGO, a researcher engaged in sustainability research for a think tank or university or a business professional in the area of corporate social responsibility. \r\n\r\n The program was developed by the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies, a leading international and interdisciplinary research centre of the University of Leuven. The Centre conducts fundamental academic research but is also involved in sustainability research for a wide range of institutions including UN agencies, European Union institutions, national governments and private actors. It brings together renowned faculty and shares its knowledge through different channels including academic papers, webinars, roundtables and conferences. ",

This course centers on the role of urban development in accomplishing the SDGs, with a specific focus on SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. \r\n\r\n Understanding the future of cities is essential for comprehending the future of humanity. Scholars predict that the 21st century will witness a monumental shift in human history as a vast majority of the world's population migrates to cities, creating a planetary urbanism. This transformation impacts global living standards, economic organization, and environmental implications in the Anthropocene era.\r\nAdditionally, this course concentrates on urban growth in the global South, where most of the planet's urbanization will occur. It draws from the insights of the PEAK Urban program, a five-year collaborative effort involving researchers from China, Colombia, India, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. This program seeks to explore and address the challenges and opportunities associated with urban development in the regions experiencing significant growth. \r\n\r\n By examining the interplay between urbanization and sustainable development, the course aims to promote effective strategies for achieving SDG11 and advancing sustainable cities and communities. By identifying key factors influencing urban growth and exploring best practices from different regions, participants can contribute to global efforts in building a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.

In the first, we tackle the most immediate questions associated with conversational AI: how do we adjust our assessments so that we are assured we are still assessing student learning, not just students ability to get answers from a chatbot? But while part of that involves defensive changes to our assessments, this mini-course goes far beyond these steps to cover how we can embrace conversational AI as a calculator for writing and support student brainstorming, authoring, and revisionas well as design some innovative new assignments that would not be possible without AI assistance. \r\n\r\n In the second mini-course, Chatbots for Instruction, we look at how to get students hands-on with conversational AI technology and use it directly in the instructional process. We break this task into three general domains: how we can use AI as an ever-present and always-ready teacher to support student learning; how students can use AI as a lab partner, debate opponent, or other sort of equal position in their education; and how we as educators should teach students about AI itself through these exercises so they are prepared for the next generation of AI tools. \r\n\r\n In the third mini-course, AI for Teacher Assistance, we focus on how generative AI can help us even if students never use it directly. From assisting with curriculum planning and authoring assessments to support routine course delivery procedures to enhancing our courses with rapid response new content and activities, AIs greater potential is in how it can be the worlds most available and knowledgeable teaching assistant. \r\n\r\n By the end of this certificate series, our goal is for teachers to go from anxious or ambivalent about the new era of AI in education to excited and ready to handle its increasing role.

        "description": "The Masters Pathway in Foundations of Sustainable Development Professional Certificate is for learners who want to earn academic credit towards a Masters degree. \r\n\r\n Sustainable development is the most urgent challenge facing humanity. Its fundamental question is: How can the world economy continue to develop in a way that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable to face global challenges? A thriving global society relies on the stability of the Earth and its resilience across oceans, ecosystems, waterways, biodiversity, the atmosphere, and more. So, how do we shape sustainability at a global scale? And with the growing demand for green skills in jobs around the world, how can professionals drive sustainability in their industries? \r\n\r\n The Masters Pathway is a partnership between the SDG Academy and University College Dublin (UCD), one of Europes leading universities, to give learners a flexible, accredited pathway to further education in the field of sustainable development. Students who complete the Masters Pathway on edX will be eligible to receive 10 credits towards  UCDs online Professional Diploma in Foundations of Sustainable Development .* Once they complete the Diploma, students can continue into  UCDs Masters of Science (MSc.) in Sustainable Development  offsetting those academic credits and providing a pathway for learners with nontraditional academic backgrounds. \r\n\r\n Delve into the foundations of sustainable development and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with world-renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs, environmental scientist Johan Rockstrom (one of TIME magazines 100 most influential people of 2023), and other global leaders in the field. For this graduate certificate, you will learn the tenets of sustainable development and how our societies can develop within the planets boundaries to prevent biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, and environmental degradation. \r\n\r\n From learning the interactions between sustainable economic growth and environmental sustainability to understanding activities that drive climate change and the boundaries set by the planets natural resources, this sustainable development micro-credential will set you on a path to tackle challenges locally and globally. \r\n\r\n *To apply the 10-credit edX  Masters Pathway  Professional Certificate towards the UCD Professional Diploma, students must go through the UCD application process, which includes references and an English language requirement.

El analisis de estos datos es conocido como inteligencia de negocios o business intelligence y es fundamental para la toma de decisiones.  \r\n\r\n Este Programa de Certificacion Profesional, compuesto por dos cursos en linea, te ayudara a comprender este contexto actual y que criterios deben tener en cuenta quienes formulan politicas publicas al momento de redactar o desarrollar leyes, regulaciones o politicas en materia de proteccion de datos y privacidad, asi como aspectos practicos de los programas de gobernanza de datos.  \r\n\r\n Los cursos online que hacen parte de este programa son: gobernanza de datos personales en la era digital y proteccion de datos personales en la era digital. Comienza a aprender sobre el manejo de los datos. \r\n\r\n La proteccion de los datos personales ha tomado gran importancia en los ultimos anos. Ello se debe a que las organizaciones de todo tipo se valen de herramientas tecnologicas y digitales que permiten organizar la informacion, incluyendo los datos personales, para darle tratamiento de manera mas rapida, eficiente y efectiva. El avance tecnologico permite a las organizaciones, gobiernos, y agentes sociales, potenciar sus capacidades de operar y lograr sus metas y objetivos. \r\n\r\n Mientras que hace treinta anos una visita al supermercado apenas involucraba intercambiar informacion sobre el valor de los productos para realizar el pago de los mismos, hoy por hoy existen supermercados que usan tecnologia digital de la informacion y la comunicacion para rapidamente identificar al comprador, identificar los productos que pone en su canasta, y sin necesidad de sacar dinero o tarjetas de credito del bolsillo, hacer el pago automatico simplemente saliendo de la tienda con los productos recien sacados del estante. Todo ello se logra gracias al procesamiento de informacion, entre ella datos personales (identificacion, cuentas bancarias, habitos de compra, etc.). Lo mismo ocurre cuando hay intercambios sociales, comerciales o de simple informacion en internet, a traves de aplicaciones, a traves de sitios web. \r\n\r\n En este escenario rico en informacion y especialmente en datos personales, se requieren reglas para el adecuado manejo de este tipo de informacion. Esas reglas son especialmente importantes cuando la informacion compartida digitalmente se refiere a datos de salud, preferencia sexual, origen racial, creencias religiosas, informacion genetica, numero telefonico, origen etnico, opiniones politicas, informacion bancaria, entre otros datos personales. En este ambito, asuntos como la implementacion de protocolos de manejo de informacion, asi como de medidas de seguridad para el manejo de los datos personales, son de suma importancia. \r\n\r\n Todos aquellos agentes de la comunidad que realicen tratamiento de datos personales, especialmente en estos tiempos altamente digitales, deben poner la proteccion de los datos personales como una prioridad de sus organizaciones, de sus colaboradores, de sus directivos, de sus proveedores. Los titulares de los datos personales tienen derechos que han de ser protegidos y las organizaciones deben establecer mecanismos, procesos y protocolos para ello. \r\n\r\n Si bien no todos los paises tienen las mismas reglas, existen principios orientadores, aproximaciones similares, y otras diametralmente diferentes. Es importante que se conozcan los diferentes enfoques frente a la privacidad y los datos personales, ya que el mundo digital involucra muchas veces la interaccion con agentes de otros paises y sujetos a otras jurisdicciones. \r\n\r\n Este Programa de Certificacion Profesional, compuesto por dos cursos en linea, te ayudara a comprender este contexto actual y que criterios deben tener en cuenta quienes formulan politicas publicas al momento de redactar o desarrollar leyes, regulaciones o politicas en materia de proteccion de datos y privacidad, asi como aspectos practicos de los programas de gobernanza de datos.\r\nLos cursos online que hacen parte de este programa son: gobernanza de datos personales en la era digital y proteccion de datos personales en la era digital.

        "description": "Underestimating project complexity is widely accepted as one of the major causes of project failure. Based on international benchmarking activities (Merrow, 2010), we know that an average of 40% of projects do not deliver what they promised. \r\n\r\n So how can you as an engineer with a technical background improve your project performance? \r\n\r\n In this program, you will learn the project management skills you need to successfully manage engineering projects. First you will focus on the early project phases, which are crucial to achieve project success. The areas covered include the project manager and the team, the project process and the project context. At the end of this part of the program you will have created your own project execution plan. \r\n\r\n But how will you deal with the inherent uncertainties linked to the length and scale of engineering and infrastructure projects and their constantly changing environments? As with most external factors, many of the causes and consequences of these uncertainties are difficult to avoid or control. Attempts to overcome these challenges by simply trying to reduce their causes is not enough. \r\n\r\n In the second part of the program you will learn our approach to mastering project complexity, focused on front-end development and teamwork. You will develop the skills you need to make timely actions in order to tackle complexities and improve your chances of project success. \r\n\r\n You will learn to identify what makes a project complex and how to perform a complexity assessment. You will analyze these elements in the context of your own project. Then, based on our complexity framework, you will identify the complexity footprint of your project and use it to adapt your management processes.  \r\n\r\n This course has been designed by TU Delfts international experts on Project Complexity, and is based on more than 60 years of practical experience as well as relevant research in the field. We see projects still fail and there is a need to do things differently. Thats what this course is about: delivering the best practices for project execution based on our state-of-the-art research.

        "description": "Whether you want to make a strong start to a masters degree, solidify your knowledge in a professional context or simply brush up on fundamentals in probability and statistics, this program will get you up to speed. \r\n\r\n Statistics is used quite intensively in many engineering contexts and masters programs. As soon as you are dealing with real-life data, you will need to get an idea of what these data tell you and how you can visualize this (descriptive statistics). You will also want to perform some analysis (inferential statistics), build a model that mimics reality, estimate some quantities, or test some hypotheses. Along the way you will learn how to apply these concepts to datasets, using the statistical software R. \r\n\r\n This program also provides an introduction to probability theory. You will encounter discrete and continuous random variables and learn in which situations they appear, what their properties are and how they interact. Probability theory can be applied to learn more about real-life problems, and it is useful for building models. Moreover, it provides the basis for statistics and applications in data analysis. Therefore, it is a useful subject for any aspiring engineer. \r\n\r\n These courses are self-paced, self-contained and modular, to make it easier to review specific topics and practice as often as you want without having to follow the entire courses. \r\n\r\n This program is ideal for:\r\n \r\n Prospective engineering students who want to meet the prerequisites for a MSc program, be better prepared or refresh their mathematics knowledge before starting a masters degree. \r\n Engineering or bachelor students who realize that they have a gap in their math knowledge or would like an additional challenge in mathematics not offered by their studies. \r\n Working professionals who would like to improve their math knowledge. \r\n Anyone interested in university level mathematics. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n This program will refresh your knowledge and review the relevant topics. As review courses, you are expected to have previously studied or be familiar with most of the material. \r\n\r\n This program is part of our series Mastering Mathematics for Engineers, together with Mastering Calculus and Mastering Linear Algebra.

Then imagine that baby transformed your team to be more joyful, humorous, creative, resilient, and effective, all while working remotely.  \r\n\r\nYou are about to enroll in that baby.\r\n\r\n Naomi Bagdonas and Connor Diemand-Yauman are leading experts in organizational leadership and culture. They've coached celebrities and fortune 500 executives, taught at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, and founded and led multiple organizations. Theyve teamed up with comedic minds from The Onion, Funny Or Die, and Comedy Central to create a fun, interactive learning experience to empower you to show up more authentically, effectively, and joyfully at work and life. \r\n\r\n You might be wondering: Should I really be prioritizing a course about humor? Also, was it just me, or did that baby metaphor kind of fall apart at the end?  \r\n\r\n To answer your first question: humor is what makes all the other stuff your team has to do tolerable. In this brave new world of work, when we rarely see our team members in person  or from the pajama bottoms down  it's harder than ever to foster connection, joy, and well-being in our remote teams. All the while, behavioral science suggests that creating a company culture of humor and levity is the quickest path to nurturing these things.  \r\n\r\n To answer your second question: Yes. Just roll with it. \r\n\r\n This program is designed for individuals who want to be more energized, joyful, and effective at work and for remote teams that want to feel more connected, creative, and resilient through the most challenging times. Its also for anyone who wants fewer one-hour meetings that feel like three-hour meetings with only ten minutes of useful work. \r\n\r\n You shouldnt have to choose between catching up on your favorite comedy show and learning techniques for being happier and better at your job. Now you can kill two birds (the Boredom Hawk and the Inefficiency Vulture, to be specific) with one online learning experience. \r\n\r\n Were excited to be on this journey with you. ",

In Statistics.coms MLOps with GCP program you will learn to combine data engineering and data science skills to deploy machine learning models. \r\n\r\n Most of the work in deploying AI models does not lie in developing models.  Rather, it lies in developing, monitoring and maintaining an automated, self-monitoring data pipeline through a model and into actions. The common practice of tossing a project back and forth between pure data scientists and pure data engineers leads to delay and errors.  This has created a need for AI engineers who have knowledge of each function. Mastering machine learning deployment skills on the Google Cloud platform is a sure path to career success. \r\n \r\n In this course, you will learn how to work with data scientists to deploy machine learning models that can learn from data, and generate predictions, recommendations or decisions.  This process usually is automated and that is where MLOps and AI engineering skills are needed. \r\n \r\n You will focus on developing the skills needed to create a GCP pipeline that:\r\n \r\n Ingests data to train a predictive model \r\n Feeds the model as it operates \r\n Scores the data on an ongoing basis \r\n Outputs an action \r\n Integrates into business applications \r\n \r\n\r\n Additionally, you will learn to develop the pipeline so that it will continuously monitor several points of operation, including the incoming data (for data drift) and the decision outputs (for anomalies).\r\nStatistics.com is the training platform of Elder Research (elderresearch.com), an internationally recognized data analytics consulting firm that, since 1995, has consulted for hundreds of leading businesses in data strategy, data science, and data engineering.

Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not computation appreciation courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. \r\n\r\n Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation, the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity, and some simple algorithms and data structures. Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving.

        "description": "According to Gartner's research, by 2025, over 70% of organizations will use citizen-developed applications. The rise in using citizen development is because of an extreme shortage of software developers plus the rising cost of traditional software development. In addition, as organizations transform digitally, there is an increasing need for business applications. Therefore, citizen developers are needed to meet the growing demand for digital business applications. \r\n\r\n Citizen Developers need to master a new set of skills to succeed. \r\n \r\n Many citizen developers are skilled in business analysis, marketing, or business strategy. They have excellent critical thinking skills and analytical skills. However, citizen developers can be more effective if they acquire design thinking, product development and management, collaboration, customer education, and stakeholder management skills. \r\n\r\n This program describes how to build a training program that will give the citizen developers the knowledge and skills to create valuable no-code/low-code digital applications. First, we teach citizen developers how to use design thinking to build effective business solutions. Then, citizen developers will learn how to create empathy for the customers' problems, visualize possible solutions through design workshops, and use rapid prototyping to test and deploy no-code/low-code solutions. \r\n   \r\n Once the no-code/low-code business application has been validated through prototyping, citizen developers will learn the basics of product development and management. Product development and management skills will aid citizen developers in supporting and enhancing the no-code/low-code products while educating customers on how to gain the most value from the products. \r\n\r\n One of the most significant partnerships for citizen developers is the IT Department. Citizen developers and the IT staff must have a good working relationship to build good no-code/low-code applications that are secure and integrate well with the organization's IT architecture. In addition, citizen developers should know when to develop applications independently and when to call in help from the IT Department. \r\n \r\n Finally, this program will help teach citizen developers an agile project management method that is easily customizable to the unique needs of citizen development. Using Disciplined Agile, citizen developers will create Ways of Working (WoW) that provide just enough project management so they can deliver no-code/low-code solutions fast while maintaining high quality. \r\n\r\n This certificate program is unique because it is the first training program to address citizen developers' learning and development needs. According to Mendix's 2021 survey of 2,025 IT professionals in six countries, in organizations that use no-code/low-code platforms, 56% of employees use citizen-developed apps. Thirty-three percent of organizations surveyed use citizen-developed apps for mission-critical operations. In addition, No-code/low-code projects reduce software application costs by 53% while delivering the applications 56% faster than traditional software projects. \r\n\r\n Get ahead of the citizen development revolution and prepare your organization for success by strengthening the essential skills for your citizen developers!

Si hoy hablamos de una Industria o Logistica de cuarta generacion, es porque antes hubo una Logistica 1.0, 2.0 y 3.0. Bueno, en realidad, lo primero que debemos saber es que el termino se ha modernizado un poco debido a una clara influencia de la jerga informatica utilizada para designar nuevas versiones de software o sus diferentes actualizaciones, con sucesivas cadenas numericas: 1.0, 1.1, 2.4, 3.0, etc. Pero en realidad, cuando hablamos de Industria 4.0 hablamos de algo que nos suena mucho mas familiar si le otorgamos su nombre original: la cuarta Revolucion Industrial. La logistica necesaria para el tipo de industria que surge a partir de esta cuarta revolucion acoge esta misma terminologia y de ahi el termino de Logistica 4.0. \r\n\r\n La logistica 4.0 de esta manera se apropia del avance en la tecnologia para la resolucion de problemas complejos de manera eficiente, por lo cual en este contesto la analitica de datos toma un papel importante. La analitica de datos permite a las organizaciones hoy dia analizar grandes volumenes de informacion para generar conocimiento que apoye la toma de decisiones en toda la cadena de abastecimiento. \r\n\r\n Python es un lenguaje de programacion lanzado en 1991, creado por Guido Van Rossum. Hoy dia es uno de los lenguajes de programacion de codigo abierto mas utilizados por la comunidad cientifica para el desarrollo de soluciones analiticas, con paquetes de probabilidad, estadistica, generacion de graficos, Big Bata, Machine Learning, optimizacion, entre otros. \r\n\r\n Python permite emplear metodos analiticos actualizados de manera gratuita, lo que ayuda a las personas que lo conozcan generar valor en las organizaciones para convertir datos en conocimiento.

Segun datos de la Organizacion Internacional del Trabajo, mas de la mitad de los trabajadores tienen este tipo de padecimiento en su entorno de trabajo (China 73%, Mexico 75%, Estados Unidos 59%). Estos numeros se incrementaron notablemente debido a la pandemia.  \r\n\r\n El impacto de los factores de riesgo psicosocial y el estres en el lugar de trabajo es un problema de salud que ha afectado a nivel global a empresas, trabajadores y profesionales.  \r\n\r\n De acuerdo con la Organizacion Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) y la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS), la gestion de organizaciones requiere de actores con habilidades para identificar y analizar las caracteristicas de los factores psicosociales en el trabajo, mismos que se ven reflejados en las interacciones entre el trabajador y el particular contexto de su organizacion, a traves de elementos como la cultura y clima organizacional, la satisfaccion en el trabajo, cuando existe un ambiente laboral positivo, y la salud ocupacional, entre otros.  \r\n\r\n Promover un buen clima laboral y un ambiente agradable permitira reducir el estres y construir un ambiente de trabajo positivo influyendo en la salud, la comunicacion interna y la actitud positiva de los colaboradores, en su vida personal y en la productividad de la empresa, lo que optimizara la jornada laboral, reducira gastos y absentismo laboral, y elevara los rendimientos de tu organizacion.  \r\n\r\n Las competencias adquiridas en este curso te permitiran desarrollar de manera estrategica, acciones que beneficien a tu espacio de trabajo, ademas de permitirte una toma de decisiones apropiada que te permita cumplir con los requerimientos de dichas normativas. \r\n\r\n Para el caso de Mexico, se recomienda complementar el programa con el mooc  Consideraciones para el cumplimiento y aplicacion de la NOM-035.

        "description": "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lies at the core of the AI Engineering function. In Statistics.coms MLOps with AWS program you will learn to combine data engineering and data science skills to deploy machine learning models. \r\n\r\n Most of the work in deploying AI models does not lie in developing models.  Rather, it lies in developing, monitoring and maintaining an automated, self-monitoring data pipeline through a model and into actions.  The common practice of tossing a project back and forth between pure data scientists and pure data engineers leads to delay and errors.  This has created a need for AI engineers who have knowledge of each function. Mastering machine learning deployment skills on the Amazon Web Services platform is a sure path to career success. \r\n \r\n In this course, you will learn how to work with data scientists to deploy machine learning models that can learn from data, and generate predictions, recommendations or decisions.  This process usually is automated and that is where MLOps and AI engineering skills are needed. \r\n\r\n You will focus on developing the skills needed to create an AWS  pipeline that:\r\n \r\n Ingests data to train a predictive model \r\n Feeds the model as it operates \r\n Scores the data on an ongoing basis \r\n Outputs an action \r\n Integrates into business applications \r\n \r\n\r\n Additionally, you will learn to develop the pipeline so that it will continuously monitor several points of operation, including the incoming data (for data drift) and the decision outputs (for anomalies).\r\nStatistics.com is the training platform of Elder Research (elderresearch.com), an internationally recognized data analytics consulting firm that, since 1995, has consulted for hundreds of leading businesses in data strategy, data science, and data engineering. Elder Research leverages the wisdom gained by solving a wide variety of real-world problems to infuse their education programs on the Statistics.com platform with the most cutting-edge training that can be applied day one.

From a biographical history of the playwright and his time to a review of his notables outsider characters: the disturbing and uncanny others whose presence at the margins of society is both celebrated and contested. From lectures filmed on-location in Venice, London, and Stratford-upon-Avon to conversations with artists, academics, and librarians at Harvard, you will have unprecedented access to a range of resources for unlocking Shakespeare's classic plays. You will also be invited to share your own theatrical interpretations and to consider how the meaning of a work of art changes depending on the time, context, and culture. \r\n\r\n In Shakespeares Life and Work, learn how to read William Shakespeare's plays through his biography, Elizabethan and Jacobean history, and modern performance. Moving between the world in which Shakespeare lived and the present day, this course will introduce different kinds of literary analysis that you can use when reading Shakespeare.  \r\n\r\n In William Shakespeares Hamlet, the ghost of the dead King of Denmark appears to his son, setting off a chain of events that culminates in the plays notoriously bloody finale. But how would this mysterious figure have been understood in Shakespeares world? Youll learn the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how people in Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and the ways that Shakespeares Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. \r\n\r\n In William Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice, the Jewish moneylender Shylock proposes a merry sport to the merchant Antonio: he will lend Antonio the money he needs if Antonio agrees to let Shylock take a pound of his flesh should he default. But what does Shylock want from the bond, and how merry does the play ultimately prove? In this section, youll be introduced to Jewish history in Venice and in England, to the ways in which Shakespeares own audience might have responded to the play and its genre, and to the history of the plays production through the twenty-first century. \r\n\r\n In William Shakespeares Othello, the Venetian general Othello represents himself to Desdemona and to the Venetian Senate through fantastic tales. Othellos stories  about himself, to himself, and to others  sets in motion a tragic romance. Youll learn the ways in which Shakespeare's characters tell stories within the play; how actors, directors, composers, and other artists tell stories through Othello in performance; and how the play grapples with larger issues including power, identity, and the boundary between fact and fiction.

Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of every part of a business. \r\n\r\n This DevOps on AWS   series teaches you how to use the combination of DevOps philosophies, practices and tools to develop, deploy, and maintain applications in the AWS Cloud. Benefits of adopting DevOps include: rapid delivery, reliability, scalability, security and improved collaboration. \r\n\r\n AWS provides a set of flexible services designed to enable companies to more rapidly and reliably build and deliver products using AWS and DevOps practices. These services simplify provisioning and managing infrastructure, deploying application code, automating software release processes, and monitoring your application and infrastructure performance.  \r\n\r\n This series has a significant hands-on component involving the AWS Free Tier in which you will explore AWS services and concepts using AWS SDKs, AWS APIs, and the AWS Console. \r\n\r\n The first course introduces you to essential AWS products, services, and common solutions. The course covers the fundamental concepts of compute, database, storage, networking, monitoring and security that learners and professionals will need to know when working with AWS. \r\n\r\n The second course discusses topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated. You will explore AWS Services that will help your application delivery, like AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline. \r\n\r\n The third course talks about how to improve the deployment process with DevOps methodology, and also some tools that might make deployments easier, such as Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, and AWS CodeDeploy. \r\n\r\n Finally, the last course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance.

        "description": "Classical detectors and sensors are ubiquitous  examples include heat sensors in cars, light detectors in camera cell phones and magnetic field sensors in navigation systems. Leveraging advances in the theory of noise and measurement, an important paradigm of quantum metrology has emerged. Here, ultra-precision measurement devices collect maximal information from the world around us at the quantum limit. This enables a new frontier of perception that promises to impact machine learning, sensing platforms, autonomous navigation, surveillance strategies, information processing, and communication systems.  \r\n\r\n In this MicroMasters, students will learn the fundamentals of state-of-the-art quantum detectors and sensors with an emphasis on the important applications of quantum networking.   \r\n\r\n In addition, they will also learn the important foundational principles of quantum computers, quantum information, quantum communications, quantum sensors and quantum bits. They will be introduced to state-of -the-art quantum computing architectures and their working principles and will also gain hands-on experience programming real quantum machines. \r\n\r\n Courses in this program are designed to introduce both physics and engineering aspects of quantum technologies, in particular quantum detectors/sensors/networking/computing, with minimal prerequisite courses. Basic undergraduate physics and mathematics courses found in typical sophomore or junior-level engineering or science degrees are sufficient. ",

        "description": "This certificate program consists of two mini-courses: (1) A Gentle Introduction to Probability; and (2) Random Variables  Great Expectations to Bell Curves. \r\n\r\n The first course provides an introduction to basic probability concepts. Our emphasis is on applications in science and engineering, with the goal of enhancing modeling and analysis skills for a variety of real-world problems.   \r\n\r\n In order to make the course completely self-contained (and to bring back long-lost memories), well start off with Bootcamp lessons to review concepts from set theory and calculus. Well then discuss the probability axioms that serve as the basis for all of our subsequent work  what makes probability tick?     \r\n\r\n The next venues on our tour are the concepts of independence and conditional probability, which allow us to see how the probabilities of different events are related to each other, and how new information can be used to update probabilities. The course culminates in a discussion of Bayes Rule and its various interesting consequences related to probability updates. \r\n\r\n The second course discusses properties and applications of random variables.   \r\n\r\n Well begin by introducing the concepts of discrete and continuous random variables.  For instance, how many customers are likely to arrive in the next hour (discrete)?  Whats the probability that a lightbulb will last more than a year (continuous)? \r\n\r\n Well learn about various properties of random variables such as the expected value, variance, and moment generating function.  This will lead us to a discussion of functions of random variables.  Such functions have many uses, including some wonderful applications in computer simulations. \r\n\r\n If you enjoy random variables, then youll really love joint (two-dimensional) random variables. Well provide methodology to extract marginal (one-dimensional) and conditional information from these big boys. This work will enable us to study the important concepts of independence and correlation. \r\n\r\n Along the way, well start working with the R statistical package to do some of our calculations and analysis. \r\n\r\n By the end of the course, you will have the technology to model and evaluate a variety of real-world systems in which randomness is present.

Los mapas, los paisajes, las obras de arte, los medios de masas, las peliculas de cine y las paginas de internet nos hablan. Debemos conocer sus codigos para entenderlas. \r\n\r\n Este programa XSeries pretende poner al servicio del estudiante las claves para analizar las imagenes que los seres humanos hemos producido a lo largo de la Historia. El dominio de su lenguaje nos permitira percibirlas en su totalidad y por los cinco sentidos. Por tanto, abarcamos la lectura de tres tipos de imagenes: los mapas, el paisaje y las imagenes historicas entendidas en un sentido amplio y como fuentes de informacion. No olvidemos que la historia de las imagenes es mas amplia que la historia del arte. La primera engloba a la segunda. \r\n\r\n La especie humana, desde sus origenes, ha elaborado imagenes con fines religiosos, informativos o placenteros. La sociedad ha experimentado un proceso de multiplicacion iconica. Una densidad figurativa o abstracta que se ha acelerado en los ultimos siglos. El homo sapiens se ha ido transformando cada vez mas rapidamente en homo videns. Puesto que ni mucho menos eran iguales el numero de pinturas que contemplaba el chaman en las cuevas prehistoricas que la marana de anuncios, carteles, periodicos, portales, simbolos, senales y signos que nos asaltan en nuestra vida cotidiana. En la historia de la humanidad se ha verificado, pues, el paso de la pintura sagrada del santuario rupestre a la actual era de la saturacion de imagenes. \r\n\r\n Lo unico se ha hecho multiple. La singularidad del original se ha vulgarizado en la pluralidad de las copias. El carisma del aura se ha desvanecido a manos de la reproduccion mecanica. Pero esas imagenes que han hecho de la sociedad una densa iconosfera, lo mismo pueden interpretarse como pedagogia popular que como mirada autoritaria.  \r\n\r\n En suma, en este programa XSeries ofrecido por la Universidad Autonoma de Madrid seguiremos la trayectoria de las imagenes desde la cueva de Altamira hasta la globalizacion iconica de nuestro tiempo, permitiendonos entender el momento historico que representan.

These four MOOCs investigate the practice of womens history; they explore how and why we write womens history, and why it is important that we do so. \r\n\r\n Together we will learn how women began to ask for equality and what the word equality meant and still means for different women. But we'll also ask you to consider a more difficult set of questions that revolve around whether equality for some women might limit the freedom of others. Will women demand benefits for themselves that provide a few with equality with men while fomenting inequality with each other? What about sisterhood?

        "description": "In this program, you will learn about more advanced attacks in the space of side-channel security: transient-execution attacks and fault attacks. In the first course. we will focus on transient execution (and speculative execution) and how it can introduce data (not meta-data!) leakage. We will use side channels to exfiltrate data and transmit it to an attacker-controlled application. We will learn about the most prominent of transient-execution attacks: Meltdown, Spectre, Foreshadow, and ZombieLoad. These attacks are so powerful that they can leak arbitrary secret data, including cryptographic keys, all without physical access. In a set of small exercises, you will implement some of these attacks. You will understand the connection between these attacks and side-channel attacks. You will gain deep understanding of the microarchitecture of modern processors, out-of-order execution pipelines, transient-execution attacks and potential mitigations against them. \r\n\r\n In the second course, we will then focus more on fault attacks, in particular Rowhammer and Plundervolt. These attacks go beyond leaking information but instead we will manipulate data. These fault injection mechanisms are triggered purely from software and allows us to manipulate control flow, secret keys, and system security mechanisms, to fully subvert systems and bring them under our control. You will understand how these attacks can be mounted, and how they can be mitigated to allow you to develop hardware and software resilient to transient-execution and fault attacks. As an advanced topic in this block, we will also mount software-based differential power analysis attacks (DPA), following a similar methodology as for the physical side-channel attacks, leaking cryptographic keys. Again we will disucss what the countermeasures against these attacks are. \r\n\r\n In both courses, you will practically apply the acquired skills in simple exercises based on measurements you perform on your own computer or measurements we  obtained from physical devices, that we provide to you.  Both courses require programming skills (C, C++, Python). We will provide you with the knowledge required beyond these, including basics on operating systems, computer architecture, and hardware design. \r\n\r\n Daniel Gruss is an internationally renowned expert in side-channel research and has written many seminal works in this field and presented them at renowned international conferences, especially on transient-execution attacks that affected the entire industry and defenses that have been implemented in all operating systems.

Circular reprocessing not only helps reduce both carbon dioxide emissions and healthcare costs but can also alleviate this pressure. \r\n\r\n The courses in this program are intended to help designers, engineers, industry representatives, hospital staff and decision makers to facilitate a transition towards a circular economy in the healthcare sector. This would bring about environmental benefits by reducing the carbon footprint and waste streams produced by hospitals and related organizations. \r\n\r\n These two courses use an interdisciplinary approach to create sustainable solutions: one from the suppliers perspective and the other one from the users/buyers perspective. The first course demonstrates how designers and suppliers can contribute to value creation in their business via the circular economy and the second helps hospitals and other healthcare organizations create smart circular economy solutions and reduce waste streams. \r\n\r\n You will learn how to deal with the scarcity of raw materials, apply circular strategies (including reusing, repairing, remanufacturing and recycling), how to set-up a green team and to make recommendations for reducing waste streams. Furthermore, you will learn to identify entrepreneurial opportunities and smart solutions to design and create proposals for circular products and processes. \r\n\r\n This program is developed by Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), ranked among the top universities in the QS World Rankings, in close collaboration with world-class experts from both the industry and academia. Therefore, it provides not only academic insights but also practical tools and examples which can be implemented in any organization, and can help you propose and develop your own circular solutions and programs. \r\n\r\n If you enroll before November 25 you will benefit from a 40% discount (USD 268 instead of USD 448) ",

It examines the legacies of colonial and neocolonial control of communications within the frame of freedoms as basic human rights, recognized the world over and codified in international and African documents as well as many national laws. The Programme offers a tool for assessing whether any restrictions on these rights meet international standards of being necessary or justifiable to protect other basic rights. Apart from legal frameworks, it also looks at other elements that make up an enabling environment where communications media can thrive and play a positive role in democracy and development. These elements include pluralism of service providers, a diversity of content and inclusive journalism.  \r\n \r\n The Programme looks closely at the implications of internet communications. The key issue here is the promotion of digital rights, the right of everyone in the online world to access, use, create and publish information on digital media, blogs, websites and social messaging. It further examines the growing danger of disinformation and the problems of Internet companies business models.  Artificial Intelligence and its possible effects on the media and journalism are also interrogated.  \r\n\r\n The core thread in this Programme is civil society engagement.  It is designed to support participants with knowledge for taking effective civil action to work for positive change in free expression in their country and beyond. \r\n\r\n The Programme shows how laws that inhibit communications freedoms can be changed or repealed. And it outlines how enabling legislation can be developed and passed. To this end the Programme also helps participants to understand how policy and law operate, both nationally and internationally, and how civil society can use formal and informal channels to make an impact.  \r\n\r\n Programme participants can learn from the experience of experts and gain ideas by engaging in discussion forums.  \r\n \r\n It is highly recommended that participants take both courses in the Programme. The second course, which builds on the first, takes a close look at the regulation of media, internet and artificial intelligence, as well as issues of access to information, the challenge of economic viability of media and further tips for civil action.

The series is designed to take you from no computer science background whatsoever to proficiency in the basics of computing and programming, specifically in the popular programming language Python. Rated as one of the most in-demand and beginner-friendly programming languages, Python training will give you a solid foundation not only for Python code but for further studies in computer science. \r\n\r\n The syllabus and course material has been used at Georgia Tech for its for-credit CS1301 class for over a year. Over 400 students on campus have completed this version of the course, and our analysis shows that they exit the course with the same learning outcomes as students taking the traditional on-campus version. This Professional Certificate uses the same instructional material and assessments as learning Python on campus, giving you a Georgia Tech-caliber introduction into the field of computing at your own pace. \r\n\r\n This Professional Certification course follows a unique design. Students will cover the general, fundamental principles of computer sciencewhich are applicable to any programming language like javascript or R  and then rapidly transition to those same programming concepts in Python. Short videos (2-3 minutes each) are rapidly interleaved with live programming problems, real-world examples, and multiple-choice questions to give you constant feedback on your progress and understanding.

        "description": "Technical analysis is a discipline that uses market data to define the state of financial markets. It provides a framework to forecast the expected trend in the market. \r\n\r\n Tools of technical analysis can be applied in any time frame. This makes them useful for day traders, individual investors managing retirement accounts or analysts preparing detailed reports that include opinions on the likelihood of gains in a market. \r\n\r\n Because the analysis is based solely on market data, technical analysis can be applied to individual stocks, broad market indexes, futures contracts, cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange or any other market. \r\n\r\n The information in these courses can be used to develop a standalone trading methodology. It can also be used as a supplement to fundamental analysis, using fundamentals to determine what to buy or sell while using technicals to determine when to make the trades. In this way, technical analysis helps an analyst add value to their reports. \r\n\r\n Fundamentals of Technical Analysis focuses on defining the tools of technical analysis including chart patterns and indicators. Quantitative Technical Analysis provides a strategy for incorporating the tools into an algorithmic format that can be automated or applied manually in a disciplined manner. \r\n\r\n Combined, the courses provide all the information needed to become a trader in any market around the world or an analyst specializing in technical reports of financial markets. \r\n\r\n This professional certificate is comprised of the following courses:\r\n \r\n C01: Fundamentals of Technical Analysis \r\n C02: Quantitative Technical Analysis \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Free Preview!

You will stop at each key Sigma tool and document it in your project storybook. These results are reviewed at each DMAIC milestone and serve as the basis for individual coaching and certification. Your completed storybook will demonstrate the operational excellence of your work and the benefits you gained.\r\nOur goal is for you to successfully complete your project, for the benefits of your project to exceed the course fee, and for you to develop the generic competence to successfully identify, implement, and evaluate future projects. To this end, we will guide you digitally and in person.\r\n\r\n Our digital guidance provides videos, eBooks and tasks to introduce every step of a project. SigmaGuide software offers frameworks for each step, while Minitab provides quantitative tools. Documenting every step of the project in a traceable way is necessary to prove methodical competence and provide a basis for steering the project.\r\n\r\n Our  personal guidance  supports your individual needs in three formats:\r\n \r\n DMAIC Phase Reviews  will review the results of each phase, correct errors, show alternatives and suggest next steps. \r\n Project Coaching  involves checking the suitability of the project topic and determining the focus (PreDEFINE), structuring the project and prioritizing the problems to be solved (DEFINE), prioritize your hypotheses and plan the collection of necessary data (MEASURE), optimizing the analysis of data, and reaching key milestones (ANALYSE). The IMPROVE phase typically does not require methodical support and the path through CONTROL is determined by ANALYSE. \r\n Green Belt Lectures : Our online Green Belt lectures reinforce topics covered in the course material, such as scientific observation, tool application, hypothesis generation, data collection, hypothesis testing (Minitab), and problem modeling - do's and don'ts. \r\n \r\n\r\n In addition, you will acquire the basics of digital lean competence with our interactive process mining module.

Los anteriores apuntan a la construccion de habilidades del siglo XXI prioritarias, como el pensamiento critico e incluyente, el pensamiento visual, la comunicacion y la sensibilidad y responsabilidad social, desde un abordaje de genero, que permiten construir relaciones diversas y proyectuales entre diferentes campos disciplinarios como los estudios de genero, la ecologia y la vida digital.

This preview course also offers an opportunity to earn an edX certificate for $49. \r\n\r\n Taught by instructors with decades of experience on Wall Street, the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) Professional Certificate program is a fast paced, comprehensive yet detailed introduction to the U.S. mortgage-backed securities market. \r\n\r\n The program covers the basics of terminology and features of individual mortgage contracts all the way through to the structure and investment characteristics of exotic instruments such as PAC bond tranches and reverse mortgage securitization. \r\n\r\n Along the way, the program will address aspects of the MBS market ranging from the creation of the basic building blocks (mortgage origination and types of mortgages), the process of turning them into investment instruments (asset securitization) and how in certain instances the cash distributions are structured to create a variety of securities from a single collateral pool (types of tranches of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations  CMOs). \r\n\r\n The majority of the program will focus on the largest segment of the market, agency (FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA) residential mortgage backed securities, both pass-through securities and CMOs. However, the other market sectors (agency multi-family, non-agency CMOs and commercial mortgage-backed securities  CMBS) will be addressed in some detail. \r\n\r\n The coverage of each type of security will address: the most frequently encountered instrument in each category as well as common variations, the type of collateral that provide the cash flows for distribution to investors, and the structure of cash disbursements. The primary themes in the discussion of each security is the consequence of all those forgoing elements with respect to the primary types of risk investors face and the way in which those elements impact expected return. \r\n\r\n Augmenting the discussion of the securities will be an introduction to the pricing conventions (including PSA and CPR speeds) and analytics (OAS analysis) as well as market-related issues such as TBA trading and dollar rolls. \r\n\r\n NOTE: Completing all 2 parts and then taking the Professional Certificate Examination is MANDATORY to achieve both the NYIF Certificate of Mastery and the edX Professional Certificate in Mortgage Backed Securities. A verified learner must pass all courses in the program with a minimum grade of 70% to earn a Professional Certificate for Mortgages Backed Securities. ",

If the current approach to urbanization does not change, most of these people will live in sub-standard conditions, lacking opportunities for income generation, occupying inadequate housing and without sustainable livelihoods. How can this gloomy scenario be avoided?  \r\n\r\n Urban design and architecture can contribute with new methods and approaches to promote the construction of more inclusive and sustainable cities. \r\n\r\n In this program you will take part in a cross-disciplinary conversation that looks into the state of cities in the Global North and Global South. We will discuss the main challenges that urban communities worldwide are facing and examine which methods and approaches can be implemented to promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. \r\n\r\n This program consists of three courses. The introductory course will help you identify what are the main urban challenges in your local environment and debate possible innovative solutions for it. The other two courses deal in greater depth with two fundamental challenges related to SDG 11: affordable housing and inequality. \r\n\r\n In each course, you will engage in a series of modules that explore a combination of innovative research with first-hand empirical material collected in cities and urban areas visited by the course team. These modules will help you grasp how housing and urban design offer tools and instruments to tackle one of the worlds main challenges: sustainable urbanization for a more sustainable and resilient urban future. \r\n\r\n Currently ranked as the World #2 School of Architecture (QS World University Rankings 2020), the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft has well-merited its reputation as a world leader in design pedagogy and innovation.

Incluso muchas veces creemos que la inteligencia se sustenta unicamente en el Coeficiente Intelectual (IQ) y no esta relacionada a las habilidades sociales. Se sabe que la inteligencia es un elemento primordial para lograr eficazmente nuestros objetivos, por lo que debemos hablar de la inteligencia como un concepto mucho mas complejo, mas alla de la aplicacion de nuestros conocimientos Que habilidades debemos desarrollar entonces? Tal vez esta es la primera vez que escuchas sobre el concepto de inteligencia emocional Se ha demostrado que las personas que desarrollan inteligencia emocional (IE) tienen un mejor entendimiento de sus emociones, experimentan mayor bienestar y tienen una mejor relacion interpersonal, lo que les permite poder trabajar y crecer profesionalmente de mejor forma, con mucha mas eficacia y felicidad. Este programa de Certificacion Profesional, compuesto por tres cursos en linea, te ayudara a desarrollar tu inteligencia emocional,a mejorar tus relaciones sociales, a dominar y entender tus propios sentimientos y a desarrollar habilidades laborales y personales, en los campos del liderazgo y la colaboracion. \r\n\r\n No es comun que esta habilidad vital para el desarrollo de la persona y las relaciones interpersonales, se ensene durante la infancia ni en la vida academica, a pesar de que las emociones juegan un papel importante en tu desempeno profesional y personal, usualmente no nos enfocamos en desarrollar competencias emocionales. El verdadero exito no se consigue sin inteligencia emocional, de hecho, no se puede llegar a ser feliz sin ella y sin el reconocimiento de las emociones. \r\n\r\n Este programa de Certificacion Profesional en Inteligencia Emocional y Liderazgo, profundiza sobre poderosos conceptos que te permitiran conocerte a ti mismo, conocerte mejor (desarrollando inteligencia intrapersonal)  y poder percibir en los demas reacciones y estados emocionales, para preverlas y manejarlas, propiciando un mejor desempeno laboral, personal y de equipo, reconociendo los estados de animo de las demas personas los cuales son campos obligatorios de la inteligencia emocional. \r\n\r\n Entender el manejo de la IE y las emociones basicas, te servira para mejorar tu salud y manejar tu estres, y asi dominar la regulacion emocional. Enfermedades como la hipertension, fibromialgia, colitis, migrana, gastritis, etc., son enfermedades comunes que pueden mejorar e incluso eliminarse con el manejo adecuado de las emociones. \r\n\r\nCompletar este programa, te permitira conocer y desarrollar herramientas para manejar tus emociones de manera positiva, lo que facilitara relacionarte mejor con las personas, armar equipos de trabajo mas eficientes y lidiar con situaciones de estres de una forma sana, este programa esta compuesto por cursos online que te ayudaran a mejorar tus competencias profesionales y conocer mas sobre regulacion emocional y la autorregulacion emocional. .\r\n\r\nLa Universidad Anahuac cuenta con el reconocimiento del QS Graduate Employability Rankings como una de las 500 mejores universidades en empleabilidad en el mundo y la coloca en el Top 3 en el ambito nacional.

Estas competencias siempre han estado incluidas en el Top10 de las competencias necesarias para trabajar en entornos presenciales y estan entre las mas frecuentes en las demandas de empleo. \r\n\r\n Todas las organizaciones se enfrentan a un entorno de trabajo disruptivo donde estan emergiendo nuevos paradigmas que afectan a la gestion de las personas y aun no somos capaces de saber cual de ellos permanecera. Sin embargo, hay unanimidad en asumir que el futuro inmediato sera mas digital que el presente que estamos viviendo. \r\n\r\n En entornos remotos el trabajar en equipo, liderar y comunicar son, si cabe, mas esenciales y, ademas, mas complejas de desempenar. Por ello, queremos ayudar a preparar a las personas que ocupan puestos de mando o que participan en equipos de trabajo a adaptar estas tres competencias a contextos de trabajo mas digitales. \r\n\r\n Por un lado, no existe una experiencia asentada en la seleccion y activacion de los comportamientos adaptados al entorno remoto, y por otro, tampoco es habitual encontrar cursos especificos donde se refuercen estos nuevos comportamientos. Debemos tener presente que no siempre se manifiestan igual que en entornos presenciales y hay que activar unos recursos personales diferentes. Por ejemplo, en entornos virtuales la comunicacion escrita o visual juega un papel mas importante en relacion a la verbal; las instrucciones se interpretan de forma totalmente diferente si no se dan con precision; y la tendencia a sentirse aislado e independiente debe combatirse con herramientas y habilidades que permitan recordar que seguimos siendo un equipo. \r\n\r\n Por otro lado, la riqueza de los canales remotos, a pesar de los avances, no esta al nivel de la presencialidad y, ademas, requiere de ciertas habilidades de interaccion con la tecnologia para mostrar la cercania que estas tres competencias requieren, a pesar de la distancia fisica entre los participantes.\r\nConstruiremos el aprendizaje mediante recursos digitales, ejemplos de experiencias, auto-diagnosticos de las personas inscritas y feedback de pares para completar una informacion 360o que permita trazar un plan de accion de gestion de cada una de las competencias.

El internet, los dispositivos moviles, el wifi y los nuevos sistemas informaticos han logrado que las relaciones de trabajo encuentren nuevos canales para compartir informacion, gestionar procesos y realizar transacciones en el mercado. El uso de correos electronicos y redes sociales ha hecho que la gente se encuentre cada vez mas cerca a pesar de la distancia.  \r\n\r\n El uso de las nuevas tecnologias ha requerido de nuevas leyes que protejan el uso de datos, tal es el caso del reglamento general de proteccion de datos o GDPR disenado por la comision europea que brinda pautas y buenas practicas para asegurar la confidencialidad de los usuarios del internet. \r\n\r\n Sin embargo, y a pesar de los esfuerzos por definir leyes que protejan los datos, trasladar servicios y procesos de negocios al internet puede generar vulnerabilidades que permitan accesos no deseados a los sistemas y pongan en riesgo la informacion confidencial de los usuarios. Las organizaciones, administraciones publicas y grandes empresas alrededor del mundo sufren constantes ataques a sus sistemas informaticos por parte del cibercrimen con el fin de secuestrar informacion amenazando con eliminar la informacion o interrumpir sus servicios en sus plataformas de comunicacion. Lo anterior generan brechas de seguridad en datos muy costosas para las organizaciones y que atentan contra la seguridad nacional de algunos paises. \r\n\r\n No solo las empresas estan en riesgo de sufrir amenazas a sus sistemas informaticos; las personas tambien viven con el riesgo de que sus datos de caracter personal sean robados y utilizados de forma indebida por causa de la ciberdelincuencia. Los sistemas de informacion personales se encuentran cada vez mas vulnerables al software malicioso que utilizan los cibercriminales. El uso de antivirus y la generacion de copias de seguridad de la informacion no es suficiente para enfrentar las amenazas ciberneticas, es por ello que resulta importante definir contramedidas que prevengan el robo de informacion y la suplantacion de identidad. \r\n\r\n Segun IBM, el costo promedio total por vulneracion de datos se registra en los $3.86 millones de dolares anuales, siendo el sector de salud el mas afectado con un gasto de $7.13 millones de dolares anuales.  \r\n\r\n Entre los ataques mas utilizados por los ciberdelincuentes se encuentra el phishing, el cual utiliza metodos de ingenieria social para secuestrar la informacion de los usuarios y cobrar por ella con la amenaza de eliminarla. Este es un tipo de ataques que ha causado 8.5 billones de registros de perdida de informacion en el 2019. \r\n\r\n Por tal motivo, los metodos de ciberseguridad se colocan como una solucion muy fuerte para comprender la mentalidad de los cibercriminales y aplicar estrategias de hackeo benefico en tiempo real que logren dar frente a los ataques que vulneren la seguridad informatica de las organizaciones y definan medidas de seguridad efectivas que protejan sistemas operativos y bases de datos. \r\n\r\n En este programa, aprenderas los fundamentos de la ciberseguridad. Identificaras las buenas practicas que llevan a la deteccion de vulnerabilidades y ciberamenazas. Reconoceras los diferentes tipos de ransomware, malware y demas ataques utilizados por los cibercriminales. Ademas, aprenderas las diferentes estrategias en materia de seguridad cibernetica y herramientas utilizadas para prevenir y dar caza a las amenazas. ",

At the same time, buildings and their energy systems are responsible for around 40% of the worldwide energy consumption and carbon emissions. \r\n\r\n In this program you will learn how to design energy efficient and more sustainable buildings whilst improving the thermal quality of their indoor environment. \r\n\r\n This Program consists of four courses.  \r\n\r\n In order to consider how to increase the energy efficiency of new and existing buildings, you will discover the energy needs and thermal behavior of buildings. You will learn to answer questions like: how does solar radiation impact the heating and cooling needs? Is there something like an optimal window size, or optimum insulation or orientation? What is the impact of ventilation on the energy needs? Why do architects sometimes design fully glazed atria oriented to the north?   \r\n\r\n A building not only has energy needs, but also energy supply. Therefore the second course takes you on a journey through the world of energy conversion and related carbon emissions. You will discover how to convert natural resources into the needed heat, cold and electricity. This course will give you the skills to choose energy systems for low  carbon buildings and building stocks. \r\n\r\n During the third course you will learn how to master a good indoor thermal comfort and how that closely relates to buildings energy systems. You will be able to answer questions like under which conditions is floor heating comfortable, or why does a comfortable temperature also depend on the chosen ventilation system. Or why there will always be comfort complains even in the building design. \r\n\r\n Finally, you will discover how to combine energy supply and (ground) storage systems and how to distribute heat, cold and air in buildings. You will know why and when to apply an all-air system, radiators, floor heating or a cooled ceiling.  You will understand the processes in air handling units and know how to maximize comfort while making sure the carbon emissions are the lowest possible. You will also discover the basics of how to optimally control all these systems. ",

Through lectures by instructors and discussions with the most influential Japanese architects, the course will trace the development of contemporary Japanese architecture and will consider its future direction. \r\n\r\n In the first course, we will focus on one of the four facets of Japanese architecture: theory. The theory portion will feature discussions with architects who played a significant role in influencing the development of theoretical frameworks that contributed to guiding contemporary Japanese architecture. \r\nThe second course, the technology portion, will focus on works by architects who explored the use of technologyfrom techniques used for traditional crafts to computational processesas a vehicle for their investigations into the conceptualization and production of architecture. \r\n\r\n The third course on City will review the works of those architects who have attempted to conceptualize cities through their architecture.  We will look back over the last half century, when the urban environment has changed dramatically with the collapse of traditional communities and population decline, and examine future issues.  \r\n\r\n The fourth course on Humans will review the works of those architects who have attempted to conceptualize humans through their architecture. How has architecture transformed in the turbulent half-century of rapid urban change, informatization, and globalization? And what has happened to the humans that architecture was supposed to have supported? Together with the architects, we will consider these questions. ",

        "description": "Nanoelectronic devices are an integral part of our life, including the billion-plus transistors in every smartphone, each of which has an active region that is only a few hundred atoms in length. This previously unimaginable scale has become possible by thoroughly understanding the critical mechanisms that take place at the scale of individual atoms and molecules. Similarly, nanophotonic devices are built into the core of modern life through technologies such as fiber-optic communications, also known as the backbone of the internet.  \r\n\r\n You can now learn how to design advanced nanoelectronics and nanophotonics from the creators of nanoHUB, the global nanotechnology research and education portal, even with no prior background in nanotechnology or quantum mechanics. A uniquely designed sequence of courses will help you develop a unified understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale electronic and photonic devices (e.g., field effect transistors, interconnects, lasers and modulators) as well as their important applications in integrated circuits and future electronic and photonic systems. \r\n\r\n This sequence of short courses builds all critical concepts from the ground up. Starting from the familiar concepts behind Ohms law, the lessons in these short courses lead naturally to a new perspective on even some of the basic physics concepts. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions about what happens at smaller length scales than we can readily observe but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons or other exotic states. Concepts and applications in nanophotonics and fiber optics communications are also discussed. Furthermore, you will learn about the key enabling characteristics of the latest advances in nanophotonic, plasmonic, and metamaterial components and systems. \r\n\r\n These courses are intended to be broadly accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. Students should have a basic familiarity with calculus, elementary differential equations, and elementary circuit concepts such as Ohms law. No prior acquaintance with quantum mechanics is assumed. An introductory level understanding of basic semiconductor physics will also be helpful. This topic will be briefly reviewed in this MicroMasters program and pointers to web-based lectures that cover background topics will be provided. \r\n\r\n Our distinguished faculty will share their unique perspective built over 30+ years of leading-edge research and educational innovation in nanotechnology.

        "description": "Almost all software is under attack today, and many organizations are unprepared in their defense. This professional certificate program, developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a project of the Linux Foundation, is geared towards software developers, DevOps professionals, software engineers, web application developers, and others interested in learning how to develop secure software, focusing on practical steps that can be taken, even with limited resources to improve information security. The program enables software developers to create and maintain systems that are much harder to successfully attack, reduce the damage when attacks are successful, and speed the response so that any latent vulnerabilities can be rapidly repaired. The best practices covered in the course apply to all software developers, and it  includes information especially useful to those who use or develop open source software. \r\n\r\n The program discusses risks and requirements, design principles, and evaluating code (such as packages) for reuse. It then focuses on key implementation issues: input validation (such as why allowlists and not denylists should be used), processing data securely, calling out to other programs, sending output, cryptography, error handling, and incident response. This is followed by a discussion on various kinds of verification issues, including tests, including security testing and penetration testing, and security tools. It ends with a discussion on deployment and handling vulnerability reports.  \r\n\r\n The training courses included in this program focus on practical steps that you (as a developer) can take to counter most common kinds of attacks. It does not focus on how to attack systems, how attacks work, or longer-term research.  \r\n\r\n Modern software development depends on open source software, with open source now being pervasive in data centers, consumer devices, and services. It is important that those responsible for cybersecurity are able to understand and verify the security of the open source chain of contributors and dependencies. Thanks to the involvement of OpenSSF, a cross-industry collaboration that brings together leaders to improve the security of open source software by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practices, this program provides specific tips on how to use and develop open source securely.

The field of maternal and child health (MCH) addresses the physical and mental health needs of women, children, and families across their lifespan, and the five courses in this MCH program are grounded in this life course perspective. The MCH field has grown to encompass the work of the academic community and local, national, and global public health professionals, all working to ensure that women are healthy before, during, and after pregnancy.  \r\n\r\n Students will learn about the history of womens health in the larger context of the history of public health, and about maternal and child health global challenges programs and policies and the impact on the many health and political challenges that women continue to face today. These challenges are explored in more depth in a course on MCH Foundations, which provides what you need to know about the field of MCH today. \r\n\r\n To address health challenges and improve the lives of women, children, and youth globally, youll learn practical skills, including how to interpret research data and apply it, along with health behavior change theories and developing innovative programs and interventions. In a course on womens health, youll also learn how to impact health policy and create beneficial change at the population level.   \r\n\r\n As a final check on what youve learned, youll have the opportunity to apply your new skills in a capstone project. Youll be presented with real-world MCH scenarios and challenged to apply what youve learned in the four preceding courses, using critical thinking and creativity.  \r\n\r\n Those who successfully complete all 5 of these graduate-level courses and go on to apply and are accepted to the George Washington Universitys Milken Institute School of Public Health and its MCH Master of Public Health (MPH) program, can apply their coursework as 6 elective credits towards the 45 credits needed to complete the program degree. Learners who successfully complete all five verified courses in this sequence will also receive the edX MicroMasters micro-credential.  \r\n\r\n Additionally, such students would benefit from the GW Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health, one of only 13 such centers in the United States. The Center provides extra resources to help develop MCH enthusiasts into future professionals, through fellowships for practice and research, relationships with community-based organizations doing MCH work, and professional development events and activities.

Different actors in the financial sector have started to account for sustainability issues in their daily operations. Not only regulatory pressure, but also stakeholder demands, incremental transparency and comparability of sustainability data, drive the transition of the financial sector towards sustainability. While sustainability has been gaining popularity in the investment business for several years now, it is only beginning in corporate finance. But since corporations play an essential role in the sustainability transformation of our economies, it is important to understand how financing is affected by sustainability considerations and how sustainability can be fostered through corporate financing. \r\n\r\n This program will provide you with the foundations of corporate finance, banking, and sustainability and how these fields interact. There are four sustainability action areas (exclusion, ESG integration, transition, and sustainability solutions) that are relevant in the context of corporate financing. Special attention is given to the application of these action areas in the specific financing instrument: equity, bond, and bank financing. Specific impact-oriented and innovative financing approaches will be discussed, focusing on their relevance and origin, as well as possibilities to manage and measure the impact realized. Theoretical know-how will be accompanied by case studies and practical examples, to ensure that you are equipped with relevant experience that may be applied in your work environment.  \r\n\r\n These applications will also help you work on capabilities beyond the scope of this program, such as the critical reflection of public information and data and the feasibility to form your own opinion.  \r\n\r\n Specific impact-oriented and innovative financing approaches will be discussed, focusing on their relevance and origin, as well as possibilities to manage and measure the impact realized.

If we meet this challenge it can help us to tackle the climate, biodiversity and food crises. If we fail then it will make these threats worse. While we have to feed the world population, we also must consider how we manage nutrients and fertilisers to grow all this food. Inefficient and excessive use of fertiliser, particularly nitrogen, leads to environmental pollution, can exacerbate climate change, and threatens human and ecosystem health.  \r\n \r\n This Professional Certificate will provide you a basic understanding of effective nitrogen management.  \r\n \r\n The course will first introduce the global nitrogen challenge, how nitrogen has helped human civilization to develop, and how its misuse now threatens us.  \r\n \r\n Regardless of your background, you will learn core concepts about nitrogen and global change, their challenges and opportunities. Key topics include food security, climate change, air pollution, water pollution, and human health.  \r\n \r\n Good measurements are key for tackling the nitrogen challenge. After completing the first course, you will move on to the second, intermediate-level course where youll gain guided training in everything from greenhouse gas flux measurements, to ammonia flux measurements, to a number of plant and soil nitrogen measurements.  \r\n \r\n You will learn about the many different forms of nitrogen, such as nitrate, urea, and ammonium, the ways in which they can be monitored, and the ways in which better understanding of processes such as nitrification, denitrification, plant uptake and leaching can help us to better manage nitrogen for its benefits instead of its problems.  \r\n \r\n Our scientists will bring you guided tutorial videos on measurement methods and laboratory analyses - accompanied by detailed descriptions of procedures and calculations, as well as many downloadable materials for the field and lab.  \r\n \r\n You will see how the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide is measured in the field, the equipment used to monitor ammonia losses to the atmosphere, and the core methods for monitoring the amounts of available nitrogen in both soils and plants.  \r\n \r\n Taught by instructors with decades of experience in nitrogen and global change research, these world-class courses are a collaboration between leading experts in the UK and across South Asia as part of the UKRI-funded 'South Asian Nitrogen Hub' (SANH). \r\n \r\n This Professional Certificate from the University of Edinburgh brings an engaging expert approach to the global challenges of nitrogen, as well as tackling them through good measurements.

This program will prepare learners for subsequent advanced courses and eventually careers in consultancy, research, and industry  any professions involving data analysis and optimization of real-world systems. The course is brought to you by faculty from Georgia Techs top-ranked School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. \r\n\r\n This first half of this program (Course 1) provides an introduction to basic statistical concepts. We begin by walking through a library of probability distributions, where we motivate their uses and go over their fundamental properties. These distributions include such important folks as the Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, Poisson, uniform, exponential, and normal distributions, just to name a few. Particular attention is paid to the normal distribution, because it leads to the Central Limit Theorem (the most-important mathematical result in the universe, actually), which enables us to make probability calculations for arbitrary averages and sums of random variables.   \r\n\r\n We then discuss elementary descriptive statistics and estimation methods, including unbiased estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and the method of moments  you gotta love your MoM!  Finally, we describe the t, 2, and F sampling distributions, which will prove to be useful in upcoming statistical applications. \r\n\r\n The second half of the program (Course 2) covers two important methodologies in statistics  confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.  Confidence intervals are encountered in everyday life, and allow us to make probabilistic statements such as: Based on the sample of observations we conducted, we are 95% sure that the unknown mean lies between A and B, and We are 95% sure that Candidate Smiths popularity is 52% +/- 3%.  We begin the course by discussing what a confidence interval is and how it is used. We then formulate and interpret confidence intervals for a variety of probability distributions and their parameters. \r\n\r\n Hypothesis testing allows us to pose hypotheses and test their validity in a statistically rigorous way.  For instance, Does a new drug result in a higher cure rate than the old drug or Is the mean tensile strength of item A greater than that of item B?  The second half the course begins by motivating hypothesis tests and how they are used.  We then discuss with the types of errors that can occur with hypothesis testing, and how to design tests to mitigate those errors. Finally, we formulate and interpret hypothesis tests for a variety of probability distributions and their parameters. ",

In addition, new intelligent demand of products and devices such as electric vehicles and heat pumps demand changes in the way electricity is transmitted. \r\n\r\n Why are smart grids the answer? Being robust and flexible, intelligent electrical power grids effectively coordinate energy supply and demand in a dynamic way. This enables the electricity from solar cells or wind farms, for example, to be incorporated within the distribution network. Biogas could be introduced locally within the gas network. Last but not least, smart grids also provide the flexibility needed to stimulate change in the energy market such as product innovation, privatization and internationalization. \r\n\r\n Understanding smart grids is a must for advancing your career in the energy sector, particularly in the fields of renewable energies, governmental policy, or consultancy. \r\n\r\n In the first course, you will be introduced to the layout of a smart grid, its components, its dynamics and the challenges in modeling and studying it.

        "description": "Are you looking to start a career developing software that runs on AWS? Or are you a trying to understand more about how developing applications with AWS benefits developers? Join us for the three-course Building Serverless Applications on AWS series. \r\n\r\n In the first course, Integrating AWS with the SDK, we start with the basics of AWS Identity and Access Management to understand the different forms of authentication and security when integrating AWS services. We refactor an existing application using the AWS SDK to replace storage functionality with Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon DynamoDB. Next, we investigate using compute services Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda to run our application code. In the final upgrade, we expose the application functionality as an API with Amazon API Gateway. Our experienced instructors take you on a deep dive on the workings and benefits of each service. \r\n\r\n In the second course, Serverless Architectures on AWS, we get hands on with automation tools and serverless managed services. Get your projects completed faster without needing to maintain the underlying servers hosting the managed services. Treat your infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Serverless Application Model as an automated way to build the resources hosting your applications. We use AWS Amplify to rapidly add front-end hosting and AWS Cognito to add authentication to our application. With Cognito in place, we upgrade the application API to require authentication. Next, we learn to use AWS Step Functions to move a lot of the workflow coordination code out of your applications. Using serverless services, we contrast some options for building event driven architectures with Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS and Amazon EventBridge. Join our expert instructors as we dive deep on real-world use cases for each of the featured services in the course. \r\n\r\n In the third and final course, Hands-on with AWS: Software Development Practices, we will provide a combination of video-based lectures, demonstrations and hands-on lab exercises to get you hands-on committing code that flows through a full Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline.

        "description": "The program teaches the principles and practice of MBSE - Model-Based Systems Engineering, using Object-Process Methodology - OPM. Conceptual modeling of a system's requirements, concept, and architecture is a first, critical stage in a successful process of developing any system. Recognized as ISO 19450, OPM is founded on a simple, universal ontology of objects and processes that transform them. It is a compact graphical and textual modeling language for conceptual modeling of complex systems of all kinds. \r\n\r\n Since in OPM objects and processes can be modeled as physical or informatical, it is ideal for modeling cyber-physical systems (CPSs), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, where the digital twin is prevalent, and fusing hardware and software is imperative. \r\n\r\n The programs underlying philosophy and guideline are that systems and software engineering are complementary, and a systems engineer must know the principles of both to thrive in the modern Industry 4.0 environment. OPM is key to achieving this engineering education objective because it is geared to easily and naturally specify software-intensive socio-technical systems, which also involve humans in the loop. Unlike SysML, which has nine kinds of diagrams, OPM has just one. Moreover, OPM represents the model in both graphics and natural language text, catering to the human dual channel processing and facilitating model comprehension. \r\n\r\n The program blends and balances systems science and engineering theory with practical modeling using OPCloud - OPM Cloud-based modeling environment, which is embedded in edX. The methodology part of OPM entails how to approach the problem of modeling, architecting, and designing new systems, as well as analyzing existing ones. You will learn how to define and model the problem at hand, the function of the system aimed to solve the problem, the stakeholders, the beneficiary group, and the benefit they are expected to gain. Turning to a detailed specification of the solution system, product, or service, things get more complex. During the program, you will learn the process of system design and development using MBSE with OPM. The course content was produced to be informative and entertaining. You will model various real-life systems in OPM  mainly technological, but also social and natural. Learning is made interactive through diverse, engaging exercises and interaction with OPCloud with real-time detailed feedback.  \r\n\r\n The course \"MBSE 102 - Model-based Systems Engineering: Advanced Approaches with OPM\" is a continuation for MBSE 101.\r\nTherefore, learners must take MBSE 101 before taking MBSE 102, since it is a prerequisite.\r\nThe new run for MBSE 101 will start on October 27th, 2019.  \r\n\r\n ",

The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) has been at the forefront of environmental stewardship for over 90 years and is committed to developing the next generation of scientists, business leaders, policy-makers, natural resource managers, and educators to meet the unprecedented environmental and allied social challenges of the 21st century.  This Professional Certificate program will guide anyone with an interest in environmental management to a) obtain literacy in environmental issues, b) use data of different spatial scales to drive decision-making, and c) effectively communicate environmental policy across a broad spectrum of constituencies. \r\n\r\n We will explore the evolution of environmental management among pioneering thought-leaders in conservation ecology and will utilize invaluable supplementary reading to understand how their essential texts remain relevant to this day.  Further, we will explore how early conservation and environmental movements were shaped by the reality of politics, policy, and science. Finally, we will explore how todays environmental managers inform effective policy when using a participatory, transdisciplinary approach to socio-environmental management and justice. \r\n\r\n Environmental decision-making requires an approach that best matches your skill sets and organizational needs with crucial environmental issues. We will explore case-studies of the management of large, complex systems, investigate how to scale and transfer the lessons-learned from these case studies, and explore strategies for integrating coupled human and natural systems. From these global examples, including Chesapeake Bay, the worlds best studied estuary, you will learn how to develop solutions to your organizations unique socio-environmental challenges. \r\n\r\n Best-practice environmental management goes hand-in-hand with current methods of communicating changes to complex ecosystems in a manner that is accessible to all stakeholders. Todays complex environmental challenges ranging from climate change and global warming to land use change require clear and compelling science communication. For example, diffuse sources of pollution like atmospheric emissions and subsequent deposition or groundwater contamination are difficult subjects to envision. You will learn from experienced and talented  science communicators how to generate compelling graphics and visualizations combined with an effective narrative structure that will serve as springboards for action within any organization.  \r\n\r\n Socio-environmental report cards are acknowledged as THE effective tool for communicating status and trends of socio-environmental systems and engaging stakeholders. These tools are being used on a global scale to effect positive change at the local level. Report cards releases have become media events that have sweeping community reach from schools to legislatures.  This course will walk you through the process of how these incredibly useful tools are created and disseminated. ",

        "description": "The world is moving from a linear cradle-to-grave economy to a more sustainable circular cradle-to-cradle economy. In this new world, its critical to determine if alternative (biobased) resources have the potential to become economically viable sustainable sources for the production of high value food and materials, feed and energy. This requires the development of feasible biobased business strategies and the skills to apply these strategies to operations and logistics. Companies that want to succeed in this industry must be prepared for the challenges and opportunities ahead. \r\n\r\n This MicroMasters programme consists of three courses and a capstone. The courses will teach you about the basics of biobased materials/natural resources and their conversion to useful products and services. This will help you to understand and evaluate strategic, technological, and operational aspects of running a biobased business and therefore understand the dynamics in biobased business investments and the factors that influence them. You will learn to design and evaluate biobased supply (and value) chains using quantitative methods. \r\n\r\n In the final course you will perform a capstone project in which you apply the knowledge from all courses to your own business case, which gives you the opportunity to receive feedback from experts in the field of biobased business and operations. \r\n\r\n Completion of this MicroMasters programme in Business and Operations for a Circular Bio-Economy will provide you with knowledge and tools to analyze the business and operations sides of the switch from fossil to renewable, biobased resources. Upon earning the programme certificate, you will be able to contribute substantially to managerial decision-making, as well as deal with issues regarding supply chain management and planning. \r\n\r\n Subscribe now to this MicroMasters programme and learn how to implement natural resource/biobased resource business models and seize this economic opportunity that lies ahead!

Another 239,000 mention design thinking.*      \r\n\r\n Why has design thinking become one of the most sought-after skills?  Employers are looking for problem solving, creativity, critical thinking, and analytical skills to enhance the capabilities of their employees to lead their companies into a successful future. Design thinking was developed out of the processes used by designers including user understanding and user experience, however, its application may be used to address non-product oriented problems as well from innovating new product or service possibilities to implementing procedural change, or identifying a new strategic direction for the company.      \r\n\r\n In the Design Thinking MicroMasters program, you will learn how to use the design thinking process to solve problems creatively, collaboratively and empathetically. Earning the MicroMasters program certificate will equip you with knowledge of the processes and techniques used to solve problems and innovate in the workplace.      \r\n\r\n * Source: Burning Glass Technologies ",

Science and innovation have answered these threats for generations and assisted man in managing emerging pandemics.  Consequently, diseases like Smallpox and Polio have practically been eradicated. Yet others like AIDS, SARS and Zika constantly continue to remind us that nature is bigger than us and still has much in store. This has clearly been demonstrated with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has turned our lives upside down. \r\n\r\n This program is divided into two courses: \r\n\r\n In the first course   Introduction to Cell Biology & Viruses    you will be introduced to the world of cell biology and how viruses, as the ultimate parasites, attack cells and use them to their advantage. We have specially designed video segments that will walk you through the basic workings of our cells, how DNA functions as the hard disc of the genetic heritage we received from our parents and what proteins do to keep our bodies alive and functional. \r\n\r\n We will review the world of viruses and how they differ from bacteria and other infectious agents.  Specific examples of human diseases, such as Polio, Smallpox and Flu will be discussed.\r\nIn the second course   \"Immunology: Fundamentals & Applications\"   we will review the basics of our first line of immune defenses, the innate immune system.  Furthermore, we will study the second arm of the immune system - adaptive immunity and how highly efficient antibodies and white blood cells custom tailor precise and specific knock-out of invading viruses, while establishing memory cells to protect us against future encounters with these disease-causing agents.  \r\n\r\n Based on the principles of immunity and cell biology we will learn how vaccines work. We will critically evaluate their pros and concerns and how this amazing innovation has saved millions of lives.\r\nThe last lesson will be dedicated to Coronaviruses and their biology. We will review the spectrum of the human associated Coronaviruses, including SARS CoV from 2002 and MERS CoV from 2012 - the previous Coronavirus pandemics. Moreover, special attention will be devoted to an in-depth focus on SARS CoV2 and why it has been so successful in infecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In conclusion, we will discuss various approaches to the treatment and protection against COVID-19 infection and understand how 30 years of scientific innovation has led to the mRNA vaccine revolution.

This professional certificate program covers design principles governing modern microprocessors, such as pipelining, cache memories, parallelism, prefetching, and cache coherency. Applying these concepts is critical when developing competitive computerized products. Take, for instance, a smartphone with limited battery capacity. Improved functionality can lead to significantly shorter operation time between battery charges, thus utilizing the already limited resources of a smartphone far more efficiently. \r\n\r\n The target audience for this program is practicing software and hardware engineers in need of a deep understanding of performance engineering. This program is also well suited for students who want to specialize in computer engineering and get a deep understanding of the working of modern computers. \r\n\r\n This program is derived from both undergraduate and advanced graduate courses in computer system design. It starts on a basic level and then gradually introduces more advanced concepts. The program offers a unique opportunity to learn about computer systems on a machine and assembly language level. \r\n\r\n The courses are given by Per Stenstrom, a world-renowned research leader in computer architecture. He is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE and member of three academies (Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science, The European Academy, and the Royal Spanish Academy of Engineering Science). He has co-authored around 200 publications and 20 patents and has co-founded a few high-tech startup companies. \r\n\r\n By the end of this program, you will have a deep understanding in the design of future multicore-based computers and the impact on energy efficiency and program execution time.

These phenomena are therefore the cornerstone of almost all (if not all) process industries, from traditional mechanical and chemical engineering through state-of-the-art or future energy industries such as semiconductor production or wind-turbine manufacture. Anyone embarking on a career in these industries, will have to be adept at:\r\n \r\n recognizing the fundamental elements in existing industry processes \r\n analyzing these processes in a mathematical way \r\n improving these processes by redesigning them \r\n \r\n\r\n This program offers the chance for the participant to understand the fundamental transport processes, learn how to model these processes and apply the knowledge gained from this modeling to new examples/cases. \r\n\r\n The program starts by demonstrating the role of balance equations in capturing a dynamic transport process. Subsequently, macro-scale processes are analyzed and modeled using the balance equations. Examples are drawn from mass transport, heat transfer and momentum transfer. Following this, a new type of balance equation, called micro-balance, is introduced to cover the most fundamental laws of transport phenomena. The program will also include many case studies of applications of these methods in various industries, including a heat exchanger in chemical process industry, and, dissolution time of a tablet in water from the pharmaceutical industry. \r\n\r\n The content taught in this program is structured in a particular way so that:\r\n \r\n the physical example or principle is taught first \r\n it is then converted to a mathematical formulation \r\n the mathematical equation is solved \r\n the physical significance of the result is interpreted from the solution. \r\n \r\n\r\n The learner will benefit because of the dual perspective of the program: learning the fundamentals as well as making practical applications. In both the academic world and in industry, mastering one aspect is not enough, as it is usually necessary to model both fundamentals and applications. ",

Before you know it, youll be implementing an entire tiny machine learning application of your own design. \r\n\r\n The final course of this series (MLOps for Scaling TinyML) focuses on operational concerns for Machine Learning deployment, such as automating the deployment and maintenance of a (tiny) Machine Learning application at scale. Through real-world examples spanning the complete product life cycle, you will learn how tiny devices, such as Google Homes or smartphones, are deployed and updated once theyre with the end consumer. \r\n\r\n For learners just getting started with TinyML, we recommend beginning with  Fundamentals of TinyML . \r\n\r\n This program is a collaboration between expert faculty at Harvards John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and innovative members of Googles TensorFlow team. Taught by Harvard Professor Vijay Janapa Reddi along with Lead AI Advocate at Google, Laurence Moroney, Technical Lead of Googles TensorFlow and Micro team, Pete Warden, and Head of Data/AI Practice, Larissa Suzuki, this program offers you the unique opportunity to learn from leaders and subject matter experts in the AI, Data and ML space and how to apply the emerging world of TinyML at scale.

First, you will be able to apply an invertibility criterion for a square matrix that plays a pivotal role in, for example, computer graphics and in other more advanced courses, such as multivariable calculus. The first course then moves on to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The goal of this part of the course is to decompose the action of a linear transformation that may be visualized. The main applications described here are to discrete dynamical systems, including Markov chains. However, the basic concepts afforded by eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful throughout industry, science, engineering and mathematics. \r\n\r\n In the second course you will explore methods to compute an approximate solution to an inconsistent system of equations that have no solutions. This has a central role in the understanding of current data science applications. The second course then turns to symmetric matrices. They arise often in applications of the singular value decomposition, which is another tool often found in data science and machine learning. ",

Its fundamental purpose is to help you meet current societal needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  \r\n\r\n You will learn that sustainable agriculture is more than a collection of sustainable agriculture methods and practices. It is also a process of negotiation: a push and pull between the sometimes competing interests of an individual farmer, a community, a nation, or geo-political groups as they work to solve complex problems about how to grow crops and livestock. \r\n\r\n As a practitioner of sustainable agriculture  manager, grower, food processor, distributor, retailer, consumer, waste manager, or policymaker  the Sustainable Agriculture MicroMasters program will equip you to play a role in ensuring a sustainable agricultural system. A systems perspective is essential to understanding sustainability and implies interdisciplinary efforts.  \r\n\r\n You will gain an understanding of the importance of the sustainable agriculture system in its broadest sense, from the individual farm, to the local ecosystem, and to communities affected by crop and livestock production practices, both locally and globally. An emphasis on the system allows a larger and more thorough view of the consequences of crop and livestock practices on both human communities and the environment. A systems approach gives you the tools to explore the interconnections between agriculture and other aspects of our environment. \r\n\r\n Farmers, laborers, policymakers, researchers, retailers, consumers, and managers have a responsibility to reach toward the goal of sustainable agriculture. This MicroMasters program provides you with the fundamental knowledge so that you can uniquely contribute to strengthen the sustainable agriculture community.  ",

You will learn how modern energy markets operate, the latest changes they are undergoing and the direction they are aiming towards for the future. \r\n\r\n In order to realize how one can encourage change and develop an innovative energy policy, an understanding of the economics of energy systems and its current issues is essential. Therefore, in the first course you will get to grips with the fundamentals of the energy markets and what influences their design and regulation. The economic theory is explained and illustrated using the European electricity markets. \r\n \r\n Using real life examples, we will dive into the complex energy system and understand the economic principles that drive it, the differing energy markets that exist, the important role of the electricity networks and how investment in the electricity sector is incentivized.\r\nAfter the first step, it is time to start speculating about the future. How do we transition from the present market to what the European Union has envisioned for 2050? \r\n \r\n In the second course you will learn about the economics of different renewable energy sources and other technologies that can aid this transition. You will  examine the business cases of renewable energy sources and technologies that can aid energy transition, and government policies currently being used to promote their growth. Find out how the EU intends to decarbonize. \r\n \r\n Insightful videos will teach you the driving factors behind European energy markets of both today and tomorrow. Interactive assignments will demonstrate how the merit order is chosen for different types of markets, applying the knowledge to many different scenarios. Live practice sessions will take you through the auctions and marketplaces where trading for electricity, carbon credits and government policy and subsidies for renewable energy takes place today, giving you invaluable knowledge on the inner workings of these markets. \r\n \r\n All this content and more will be the building blocks for your conversations and discussions about the future of electricity markets in Europe. After this course, it will be you in the driving seat, impacting the market to steer us away from the fossil fuel-heavy technologies and encourage movement towards sustainable visions of the future.

The Smith and Clark schools leverages the foundational courses in Digital Strategy and Execution and extend those with a simulated course experience for the Government sector. \r\n\r\n Government sector leaders that are usually program managers, directors, or unit leads need to know how to sense and respond to digital technology. At its core, the basic lessons are the same. In practice, the complexity of bureaucracy and the need to consider internal marketing (politics) within each organization is also essential.  \r\n\r\n This course series will take its learners on a digital transformation journey where they build required skills to prove mastery. The last course in this series adds required lessons and simulates digital transformation in government based on real events and a real digital transformation. This allows government leaders to apply the skills and knowledge gained in the certificate by using micro-progressed case studies as scenarios to explore and solidify knowledge against the course objectives. \r\n\r\n Course objectives include:\r\n \r\n Identify critical technologies that have the potential for disruption across markets into your market, and how to respond to them. \r\n Better sense and manage customer relationships within your organization, business partnerships, and end users to better identify opportunities and risks. \r\n Know the customer journey analytics and Lean Analytics cycle that drive adoption of technologies and engage stakeholders with your program, product, or service offering. \r\n Define your current and future capability sets, and what dynamic capabilities are needed to improve your ability to respond to stakeholder and customer needs. \r\n Establish team and organization designs that align interests and create incentives that empower people to solve problems and engage in transformation. \r\n Drive outcomes with disciplined planning and execution that change the direction and capabilities of Agile Product Teams at scale. \r\n Govern and manage the technology mix that is required to enable empowered teams with DevOps principles and practices that drive fast flow, feedback, and team learning. \r\n Know and be able to leverage relevant industry examples that serve as success stories to drive belief and vision with the art of the possible into your organization. \r\n ",

El programa esta disenado para todas aquellas personas laboralmente activas preocupadas por mejorar su calidad de vida, asi como para aquellos empresarios que buscan invertir en sus recursos humanos, reduciendo el sedentarismo y el ausentismo (absentismo) y mejorando el estilo de vida de su plantilla, incrementando asi la productividad de su compania a traves de la implantacion de una cultura de Fitness Corporativo.   \r\n\r\n Entre las principales causas de baja productividad en las empresas se encuentran el sedentarismo por la falta del ejercicio fisico y el ausentismo o absentismo generado principalmente por enfermedades relacionados a una inadecuada salud fisica o a malos habitos alimenticios.  \r\n\r\n Este programa entrega las herramientas para mejorar tus habitos de vida saludable mediante la incorporacion de la nutricion y el fitness, que te brindaran beneficios a corto, mediano y largo plazo. Conocer las bases de la nutricion y la alimentacion saludable se convertiran en un pilar fundamental para llevar una vida saludable. Si esto lo complementamos con habilidades como el manejo del estres y el bienestar seremos mas felices y mejoraremos tambien nuestras relaciones interpersonales y profesionales. \r\n\r\n De todas las areas que contribuyen a nuestro bienestar, hay una importante que la mayoria de las veces la pasamos por alto: El trabajo. Una persona laboralmente activa, pasa en promedio 23 partes de su dia en su trabajo. Por otro lado, se sabe que un empleado saludable, es un empleado mas feliz y con ello,  su productividad aumenta. Las empresas deben invertir en el bienestar de sus empleados si quieren crecer y aumentar su productividad. \r\n\r\n Desde que en el 2007 la Asamblea Mundial de la Salud de la OMS puso en marcha el Plan de accion Mundial sobre la salud de los trabajadores, son muchos los estudios que revelan que, efectivamente, este tipo de iniciativas que promueven la responsabilidad social y el bienestar fisico en el lugar de trabajo, tienen beneficios tanto para la compania como para los empleados.  \r\n\r\n Establecer una cultura donde el ejercicio fisico, la alimentacion saludable, el manejo del estres, el companerismo y el wellness corporativo sean el eje prioritario para la organizacion, crea una respuesta de compromiso del empleado en su lugar de trabajo y un afianzamiento con la empresa.  \r\n\r\n Tipicamente, los programas de bienestar corporativo, implican la participacion de un nutricionista, un medico y un profesional de la actividad fisica, quienes se encargan de implementar estrategias de promocion de la salud en conjunto con el departamento de rrhh, para fomentar la salud de los empleados y su fidelizacion con la empresa. \r\n\r\n Nuestro modelo educativo, tiene al ser humano en el centro de todo, es por eso que este programa esta enfocado en la promocion de la salud y el bienestar, entendido como la sensacion de felicidad, vitalidad y motivacion, resultado de una armonia entre las esferas biologica, psicologica, social y emocional de la persona.  \r\n\r\n Los instructores cuentan con amplia experiencia certificando empresas, a traves del distintivo \"empresa saludable\" por Anahuac Mayab. \r\n\r\n Este programa de  Certificacion Profesional, permitira a las personas mejorar su bienestar mediante la nutricion y el bienestar personal, y a  los empresarios y a los responsables del area de recursos humanos y desarrollo organizacional, establecer mejores practicas y estrategias que privilegien el crecimiento y desarrollo del capital humano a partir de la busqueda del bienestar de los colaboradores de la empresa.

        "description": "Quantum supremacy is a term that refers to the projected ability of quantum computers to perform computations that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer. The era that quantum computing promises to bring about is often likened to the era initiated by the classical computer. In such a \"quantum\" information era, quantum computers will be complemented by the quantum internet, which will allow for the transmission of quantum information over long distances. This capability would support many revolutionary applications, such as unhackable communication, clock synchronization and secure access to quantum computers in the cloud. \r\n\r\n But how do quantum computers and quantum internet work? What scientific principles are behind them? What is the hardware that is being researched? What kind of software and protocols are needed for quantum computing and quantum internet? Which disciplines of science and engineering are required to develop these? \r\n\r\n The aim of this program is to help you get up to speed with the present progresses in the transition to a quantum information era. After a quick review of some of the basic concepts that will enable you understanding the operating principles of quantum computation and quantum internet, the program will begin with an extensive discussion on some of the different ways qubits can be built. \r\n\r\n Moreover, we will discuss how a large-scale quantum processor could be built using these qubits. Some of the topics that we cover are micro-architectures, compilers, and quantum programming languages. You will also explore some of the basics of quantum error-correction, an essential procedure that allows us to combat errors that arise during computations using delicate qubits. \r\n\r\n The program then concludes with a discussion on the quantum internet: what is it? How can it be built? Why is it useful? \r\n\r\n The program is a journey of discovery, so we encourage you to bring your own experiences, insights and thoughts via the forum! ",

It focuses on explaining many macroeconomic phenomena that we either observed first hand or heard indirectly from the media. The program considers long-term economic growth in developed and developing economies. Youll also learn why a national (or global) economy experiences short-term cycles in activity (e.g., recessions and recoveries) around its long-term growth trend. \r\n \r\n The behaviour of an economy as a whole is often broadly predictable, but sometimes it can suddenly change due to a range of unpredictable factors such as regional conflicts, financial crises and health emergencies. This program explains what central banks and governments can do to try to smooth these fluctuations and to lift the living standard. Theories or models widely used by governments, central banks and the private sector to conduct macroeconomic analyses are explained intuitively as well as discussed critically. The behaviour of the financial system, including the banking system and asset markets, is also considered, especially in the light of financial crises. \r\n \r\n The three courses are based but extended on an introductory macroeconomics course taught on campus at The University of Queensland. A focus is placed on core economic principles that are immediately applicable rather than formal mathematical theorisation. A distinctive feature of these courses is their strong emphasis on the international aspect of macroeconomics. Recent global economic and non-economic events have highlighted the importance of understanding the interconnection between the domestic and the international economy. \r\n \r\n This program is for everyone, whether you are studying at university, a career professional interested in expanding your economic knowledge, or simply curious about global economic behaviour and what influences it.

All this time translates into losses or earnings for a business.  \r\n\r\n Delays in software development are mainly caused by the obstacles that exist between two areas: development and operations. Both of these work hand in hand, but each one values their own priorities: on one hand, quick pace, innovation and change are valued, while on the other hand code stability, correct implementation and optimization are greatly sought. \r\n\r\n In this sense, the concept of DevOps has revolutionized IT teams and has broken down an invisible barrier in order to work bidirectionally and collaboratively with effective communication.

With its modern principles, practices and an array of state-of-the-art automation tools, DevOps provides a collaborative path to bring your IT operations into the Agile development manifold, ultimately resulting in faster software delivery and time to market, without compromising on quality. \r\n\r\n The DevOps Practices and Tools Professional Certificate program is addressed to developers and IT operators exploring new approaches for building software, professionals focused on site reliability and quality assurance, and anyone involved in the software delivery process. \r\n\r\n In this program, you will start your journey by learning how DevOps is influencing software delivery, how cloud computing has enabled organizations to rapidly build and deploy products, new features and expand capacity, how the open container ecosystem, with Docker and Kubernetes in the lead, is truly revolutionizing software delivery, and the why, what and how of writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). You will also learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), what a deployment pipeline looks like, the role played by observability systems, what to observe and why. You will then get a solid understanding of the role that Jenkins plays in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), how to install a Jenkins server, how to build software for it, how to manage third party integrations/plugins and how to scale and secure Jenkins. And finally, you will take it a step further and learn how to build serverless functions that can run on any cloud, without being restricted by limits on the execution duration, languages available, or the size of your code. \r\n\r\n DevOps has become an important part of software engineering culture, influenced by the wide adoption of microservices, containers and cloud computing. Serverless takes the evolution of cloud-based and microservice architecture one step further, simplifying the operational part of DevOps, development and delivery, and allowing IT organizations to achieve greater business agility. \r\n\r\n The 2020 Open Source Jobs Report from edX and the Linux Foundation highlighted the strong popularity of DevOps practices - it is the most in demand job role amongst hiring managers surveyed - along with cloud and container technologies, which are the most sought after technical skills. In addition to DevOps skills being in high demand, DevOps jobs are among the highest paid tech jobs.

Here, youll learn just enough of the history of HCI to get started having real conversations about the field. \r\n\r\n Then, youll learn the fundamental design principles of human-computer interaction. Youll start with the fundamental feedback cycle that underlies all interactions between users and interfaces. With that in mind, youll then learn the design principles developed by visionaries in the field like Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood. From there, youll move into more advanced theories of HCI, including situated action and distributed cognition, then conclude by looking at how interface design can impact social change. \r\n\r\n After youve learned the fundamental principles and theories of HCI, youll move onto the design life cycle. The design life cycle covers how you iteratively gather requirements, brainstorm alternatives, prototype interfaces, and gather user feedback quickly to make fast progress in designing and improving user interfaces. Youll cover the basics of how to develop a good survey, conduct an informative interview, and control for bias throughout your needfinding processes. Youll then learn about running effective brainstorming sessions, and then prototyping at the just-right level of fidelity for your current confidence in your designs. Finally, youll learn how to evaluate those prototypes with real users, gathering their feedback for a new run through the design life cycle. \r\n\r\n After that, well briefly look at the current state of human-computer interaction, focusing on three areas: technologies like virtual and augmented reality, ideas like gesture- or touch-based interaction, and application areas like healthcare and security. In this exploration, well rely heavily on cutting-edge papers and publications from the ever-changing field of HCI. \r\n\r\n Then finally, well recap the entire course contents, and tell you what to do next to further your HCI education: whether its pursuing a Masters or PhD in the field, taking follow-up MOOCs, or beginning your own HCI research career. \r\n\r\n The material in this course is borrowed from Georgia Techs CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction, part of its online Master of Science in Computer Science program. Youll watch the exact same lectures as students in the for-credit program. ",

The post-stroke rehabilitation journey may take months to years, and even a lifetime. Therefore, every stroke survivor needs to adapt into the new normal to regain and more often to relearn certain body functions and skills. \r\n\r\n What is the cause of stroke? What factors determine the location and severity of brain damage caused by stroke? How a life could be saved during a stroke event? Whether damage and recovery are all by chance? Are there any factors determining how long it takes for recovery? Would there be full recovery?  \r\n\r\n Optimal outcomes of recovery rely on the collaboration between the survivor and the interdisciplinary stroke team. Individual healthcare professionals play different roles and approaches at different stages of the recovery journey. Independent disciplines are working dependently and cohesively to design the rehabilitation program tailored for every individual survivor. Quality stroke care skills of individual professionals can be sharpen by understanding how knowledge is being applied by different healthcare disciplines, which may promote the successful recovery of a stroke patient. Knowledge gained from this professional certificate may also help your loved ones if you have partners, friends or family members who are suffering from stroke. Regardless if you are a caregiver or stroke survivor, this Professional Certificate Program is for you. \r\n\r\n PS: Program contents may stimulate ideas on how stroke patients can continue with home rehabilitations even when hospital services are shutdown during pandemics, such as the COVID-19.

Mastering machine learning deployment skills on the Microsoft Azure platform is a sure path to career success. \r\n \r\n In this course, you will learn how to work with data scientists to deploy machine learning models that can learn from data, and generate predictions, recommendations or decisions.  This process usually is automated and that is where MLOps and AI engineering skills are needed. \r\n\r\n You will focus on developing the skills needed to create a Microsoft Azure pipeline that:\r\n \r\n Ingests data to train a predictive model \r\n Feeds the model as it operates \r\n Scores the data on an ongoing basis \r\n Outputs an action \r\n Integrates into business applications \r\n \r\n\r\n Additionally, you will learn to develop the pipeline so that it will continuously monitor several points of operation, including the incoming data (for data drift) and the decision outputs (for anomalies).\r\nStatistics.com is the training platform of Elder Research (elderresearch.com), an internationally recognized data analytics consulting firm that, since 1995, has consulted for hundreds of leading businesses in data strategy, data science, and data engineering. Elder Research leverages the wisdom gained by solving a wide variety of real-world problems to infuse their education programs on the Statistics.com platform with the most cutting-edge training that can be applied day one.

En el segundo curso te presentaremos tecnicas avanzadas de importacion de datos y estrategias diversas para consolidar y preparar los datos de forma que puedas extraer las conclusiones que necesitas (basadas en nuestra experiencia en el uso de Excel y demostradas con casos reales). Te presentaremos tambien las nuevas herramientas de modelo de datos e importacion avanzada incorporados desde Excel 2010 que permiten trabajar de forma mucho mas comoda con grandes volumenes de datos (Big Data) repartidos en varias tablas y automatizar la importacion para no tener que repetir los pasos cada vez que actualices los datos. \r\n\r\n Si eres principiante en Excel, tienes la posibilidad de empezar de 0 y conseguir un nivel avanzado de Excel para el tratamiento de datos con este   otro certificado  que incluye dos cursos de nivel principiante e intermedio, o, si quieres empezar de 0 y conseguir un certificado profesional de nivel intermedio, tienes la opcion de este   otro certificado , en el que haras esos dos primeros cursos y luego el mooc sobre el caso practico   (Excel: Creacion de un panel grafico de control empresarial) , que te permitira aplicar los conocimientos adquiridos.

In software, we will focus on different types of caches, that are one of the main targets in software-based side-channel attacks. \r\n\r\n On the hardware side, we will mount power analysis attacks on the cryptographic algorithms RSA and AES. We will see that simple power analysis attacks and differential power analysis attacks are powerful enough to obtain fine-grained information such as cryptographic keys, user input, or secrets of the operating system. This skill set and knowledge will give you the ability to spot these side channels in hardware and software projects. We will then cover countermeasures and mitigation strategies that allow you to develop side-channel-resilient hardware and software and protect your security-critical applications and sensitive information. \r\n\r\n In both courses, you will practically apply the acquired skills in simple exercises based on measurements you perform on your own computer or measurements we obtained from physical devices, that we provide to you.  Both courses require rudimentary programming skills (C, C++, Python). We will provide you with the knowledge required beyond these, including basics on operating systems, computer architecture, and hardware design. \r\n\r\n Daniel Gruss is an internationally renowned expert in side-channel research and has written many seminal works in this field and presented them at renowned international conferences, especially on transient-execution attacks that affected the entire industry and defenses that have been implemented in all operating systems.

Any individual that masters it will not only become more efficient in their own life but will also be able to help others with their own difficulties, get better at resolving conflict, problem solving, decision-making and managing interpersonal conflicts. \r\n\r\n In addition, conflict management is an essential skill to master in professional environments. Indeed, conflict is a most prevalent experience in the workplace as about one-third of employees report experiencing disagreements, instances of conflict or ongoing difficult relationships over a period of 12 months. As a matter of fact, conflict is highly detrimental to organizational functioning as it decreases employees motivation, increases stress, anxiety, and depression, and is detrimental to the finances of companies, either through an increase in sick leave or via lawsuit costs. \r\n\r\n Finally, conflict management skills are of tremendous importance in the virtual world. Indeed, by their very nature (e.g. online disinhibition, anonymity and text-only communication) virtual environments constitute places where conflicts are most likely to arise and in which interpersonal and inter-team collaboration attempts face unique challenges due to the fact that members of virtual collaborations work across cultural, geographical and time boundaries. \r\n\r\n This conflict management certification encompasses all psychological aspects of conflict and conflict management, both for internal and external stakeholders. Although work contexts will be tackled throughout the three courses, our approach will be centered on everyday life conflict skills. \r\n\r\n In each course, particular sections will be devoted to virtual environments. In the first course, we will introduce the phenomenology of conflict and describe how virtual environments influence the presence and escalation of conflicts. In the second course, we will describe negotiation strategies, and we will assess how virtual environments shape the way negotiation strategies are enacted and how effective they are. In the third and final course, we will introduce mediation and analyze the pros and cons of conducting e-mediation as well as put forward the advantages of hybrid forms of mediations. ",

Guided by expert cardiologist Dr. David Maron, you'll explore an integrated approach to patient care, including the theory of preventive cardiology and the application of evidence-based principles to real-world clinical practice. Youll examine the impact of risk factors on CAD, and how a healthy lifestyle and medications, when needed, can reduce risk and eventual onset. Leave the program prepared with behavior change strategies and appropriate use of medications that will encourage patients to understand the value of preventive interventions in managing their risk factors. \r\n\r\n In support of improving patient care, Stanford Medicine is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), to provide continuing education for the healthcare team. \r\n\r\n Credit designation\r\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) \r\n\r\n The Stanford University School of Medicine designates this enduring material for a maximum of 48.00 AMA PRA Category 1 CreditsTM. Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity. \r\n\r\n View the full accreditation information here from  Stanford Medicine . \r\n\r\n How to claim credit \r\n At the end of the XSeries Program with successful completion, a claim credit and evaluation link will be emailed to you with more detailed instructions.
